<h4>A brand's worth lies in its unique visual identity. Whether you're building a new brand from the ground up or refining an existing one, Remix Design can help it grow and thrive.</h4>

<p>No website stands alone; it's a part of your marketing strategy and your company's overall image. Your brand identity must travel across multiple media. You may need a logo, business cards, brochures, and media kits to complete the image. These materials must be bold, unique, consistent, and communicative if they are to serve in strengthening your brand.</p>

<p>The process starts by distilling your company's core message as the basis of all design choices. If an identity system already exists, we explore the ways it works for the company, and the ways it doesn't work. First, a logo is created, based on the simplest and clearest expression of the core message. Next are other essentials such as business cards, letterhead, envelopes, and presentation folders. Additional presentation, press, sales, or signage materials follow.</p>

<p>Remix Design can help you visually express your company's unique message with strength and clarity. With your vision and our design expertise, your brand will be optimally positioned for growth and success.</p>
