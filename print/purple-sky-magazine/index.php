Remix Design had the opportunity (and burden) of taking the brand from the groud up: from logo and identity to editorial concept and execution.";

$galleryInfo_solution = "J-rock is non traditional in many ways. It's not traditional to Japanese culture, and non-English music isn't traditional in the US. The audience in both countries is mostly youth. So, we broke a whole slew of editorial traditions. Bright color was used liberally and white backgrounds were rarely used. Except for columns of type, which kept to a grid (mostly), spreads were extremely freeform, treated as canvases instead of rigid blocks.";
