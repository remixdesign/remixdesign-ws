We have two children. What are our options in terms of custody?"</strong></p><p>Answer:</p><p>There are several options. The most common scenario is that one of the spouses will have sole custody of the children. That means that both children will primarily reside with one of the parents who will be responsible for making all of the major decisions for the children such as education, medical and religion. The other parent will receive visitation rights with the children.</p> <p>Another option is joint custody. This means that the children will still primarily reside with one of the parents and the other parent will have visitation rights. However, all of the major decisions pertaining to the children will be made jointly by both of the parents.</p> <p>A third option is shared parenting. This means that the children will divide their residence between the parents, with each of the parents having the children in their home approximately 50 percent of the time. In general, all major decisions would be made jointly as with joint custody.</p> <p>There are several variations on the above scenarios. For example, it is possible, although not advisable for the parent who does not have physical custody to be the sole decision maker. Another scenario would be for the children to each reside with a different parent. However, it is typically not wise to split up the children.</p><hr /><p><a name="form">&nbsp;</a></p><p>Send your question Russell via our to be included on our home page.
