You are also required to provide your name, address and show your driver's license to the person injured or whose property you damaged. </p><p><big>Assist the injured.</big> If someone is injured, make sure a doctor or ambulance is called immediately. Attempt to provide assistance to the injured person if possible. </p><p><big>Protect the scene.</big> To ensure that no additional damage is done, attempt to prevent further accidents. This can be done by moving vehicles involved in the accident and by properly illuminating the accident scene. </p><p><big>Call Traffic Officials.</big> Contact a police officer or highway official and briefly give them the facts of the accident. </p><p><big>Exchange facts with other drivers.</big> Obtain from the other drivers their names, addresses, license plate and license numbers, type of car and insurance information. Provide the same information to the other drivers. Also be sure to obtain the name and address of all passengers involved. </p><p><big>Get names of witnesses.</big> Get the names and addresses of all witnesses to the accident. If they refuse to identify themselves, write down their license plate number. Do not discuss the accident with the witnesses. </p><p><big>Write down details of the accident.</big> Write down the date, time, road and weather conditions and speed of all cars involved. It may also be helpful to draw a diagram of the cars before and after the accident. </p><p><big>Report the accident</big> to your insurance company and to The Department of Motor Vehicles. Those involved in a car accident causing injury to persons or property are required to report the details to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles within 10 days.
