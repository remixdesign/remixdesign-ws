No. 260 [1995 NY Int. 279]<br />Decided December 7, 1995
<HR>
 This opinion is uncorrected and subject to revision before publication in the New York Reports.
<p>Joel R. Brandes, for Appellant.<br />Michael P. Friedman, for Respondent.
<p>TITONE, J.:
<p>In <em>O'Brien v O'Brien</em> (66 NY2d 576), this 
Court held that a professional license acquired two months before the 
commencement of the matrimonial action was marital property subject to equitable 
distribution under Domestic Relations Law § 236B. Since that decision, the 
courts of this State have struggled with the 
problems involved in 
distributing the value of older professional 
licenses that have been utilized in the development of their holders' careers. The primary question 
presented by this appeal is whether a license that has been exploited by the 
licensee to establish and maintain a career may be deemed to have "merged" with the career and thereby lost its 
character as a separate distributable asset.
<p>I.
<p>The parties were married in 1969. At the time of their marriage, both parties 
had undergraduate college degrees and neither possessed any appreciable assets. 
Defendant husband attended law school during the first three years of the 
marriage, gaining admission to the bar in 1973. He thereafter practiced law and 
was earning an annual salary of $97,000 as a Deputy First Assistant Attorney 
General when the parties separated in mid- 1989.
<p>Plaintiff wife acquired a master's degree in psychology during the early 
years of her marriage. Over the next twelve to thirteen years, she worked as a school 
psychologist, taking time off occasionally to care for the couple's children or 
to attend graduate school. In 1984, plaintiff began attending medical school. 
She graduated in 1988 and, after completing a one-year internship, she 
received a license to practice medicine in July of 
1989. Plaintiff commenced this matrimonial action on September 1, 1989, four 
months before the completion of her second internship.
<p>By a judgment of divorce dated October 1, 1991, 
the Supreme Court awarded each party custody of one of the couple's two 
children. Defendant was ordered to pay child support and weekly maintenance and 
the marital property was divided equally between 
the parties. In determining the total value of the 
marital estate, the court included the value of 
each party's professional license as measured by the increased earning capacity 
it represented: $529,363 for defendant's law license and $903,406 for 
plaintiff's medical license. The marital estate was then divided so that each party retained the value of his or her license and pension interest. The 
marital residence was to be sold and the proceeds distributed equally. The other 
marital assets, including vehicles, investments and vacation 
property were also distributed. Both parties then appealed from the portions of 
the judgment that they deemed objectionable.
<p>The Appellate Division modified in several important respects. On defendant's appeal, the 
court held that defendant's law license should not have been treated as separate marital property available for equitable distribution because it had "long 
since merged into [defendant's] professional career" and was not "'an asset 
possess[ing] an independent identity for the purpose of computing appreciation'" 
(190 AD2d 74, 81, quoting Kalisch v Kalisch, 184 
AD2d 751, 752). Several of plaintiff's arguments 
regarding the distribution of marital property were rejected, but the court 
agreed with her contention that her medical license had been overvalued. Based on these 
and other perceived problems in the divorce judgment, the Appellate Division reversed and remitted 
to the Supreme Court for a redistribution of the marital assets as well as for a 
modification of the conditions imposed in connection with defendant's visitation rights.
<p>On the remand, Supreme Court redistributed the marital property in accordance 
with the Appellate Division's decision. The court 
also granted a defense motion to eliminate defendant's prospective maintenance because of his recent job loss. Defendant 
had applied for relief from his maintenance obligation during the pendency of 
the appeal to the Appellate Division after 
plaintiff had appeared at a press conference and accused him of engaging in 
criminal activity. The acknowledged purpose of this 
press conference was to embarrass defendant's employer, the then- State Attorney 
General, who was campaigning for a different office. As a result of these 
accusations, defendant was forced to resign from his position and had been 
unable to find new employment. The court found that defendant's job loss was not 
a self-imposed hardship and that, in view of 
plaintiff's current annual income, defendant should not be obliged to continue 
paying her maintenance. Plaintiff then took a second appeal.
<p>On that appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, 
rejecting plaintiff's contentions regarding the elimination of her maintenance 
and the purported one-sidedness of the redistribution of marital property. The 
court also declined either to exclude plaintiff's medical license from the 
marital estate or to reconsider its earlier conclusion that defendant's law 
license was improperly included. Plaintiff took the present appeal by permission 
of this Court.
<p>II.
<p>Initially, we reject plaintiff's arguments regarding the inclusion of her own 
medical license as an item of marital property available for equitable distribution. Contrary to 
plaintiff's contentions, nothing that has occurred in the ten years since 
<em>O'Brien</em> was decided suggests a reason to overrule it. The "chaos" and "confusion" that plaintiff 
perceives are really nothing more than reflections 
of how difficult it is to achieve true fairness in 
the division of a married couple's tangible and 
intangible assets. Far from undermining <em>O'Brien</em>'s pragmatic and 
theoretical worth, the decade of case-law history that plaintiff cites is an 
example of the kind of experimentation and creative 
problem-solving that the Domestic Relations Law and 
equity itself demand.
<p>Equally unpersuasive is plaintiff's contention 
that <em>O'Brien</em> should be limited to cases in which one spouse worked and 
supported the family financially while the other went to school and earned a 
professional license. Plaintiff's emphasis on the non-titled spouse's financial 
subsidy to the exclusion of all other forms of contribution represents an 
unacceptably narrow view of the economic 
partnership that characterizes the institution of marriage. Here, for example, 
although defendant apparently did not finance plaintiff's medical education, he 
was the primary provider of economic support to the 
family while plaintiff was in school. Additionally, he prepared family meals and 
tended to the children's needs so that plaintiff could devote her time to her studies and work. Thus, the evidence supports the affirmed finding below that 
defendant "contributed to the functioning of the household while plaintiff 
attended medical school." Under these circumstances, inclusion of plaintiff's 
license as an item of distributable marital property is appropriate to fulfill 
the core purpose of the <em>O'Brien</em> rule: to assure the non-titled spouse an 
equitable share of the license to which that spouse's efforts contributed. 
Accordingly, there is no sound basis for withholding <em>O'Brien</em>'s 
application here. We note that, contrary to plaintiff's contentions, there is 
also record support for the Appellate Division's 
valuation of her medical license. Consequently, the 
lower courts' distribution of plaintiff's professional license will not be 
disturbed.<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I95_0279.htm#n1a" 
name=n1><em>[n 1]</em></a>
<p>III.
<p>We reach a different conclusion, however, with 
respect to the Appellate Division's disposition of 
defendant's professional license to practice law. As a threshold matter, we 
reject plaintiff's contention that the Appellate Division lacked the power to modify Supreme Court's 
decision to distribute the license's value because 
defendant did not specifically mention that aspect of the judgment in his notice 
of appeal. Contrary to plaintiff's contentions, the scope of the Appellate 
Division's review 
power was not limited by the recitations in defendant's notice of appeal. 
Notably, there is no indication on this record that plaintiff was prejudiced by 
any ambiguity or omission in the notice. Accordingly, there is no basis for this 
Court to interfere with the Appellate Division's 
discretionary choice to construe defendant's notice of appeal liberally or 
even to reach beyond the issues it cited.
<p>Turning to the substantive question, we find 
considerable merit in plaintiff's contention that the Appellate Division erred in treating defendant's law license as 
having "merged" with defendant's career. The 
"merger" principle on which the court's decision was based is derived from the Second Department's ruling in <em>Marcus 
v Marcus</em> (137 AD2d 131), in which it was held 
that a professional license should not be assigned an independent value where the licensee has maintained a professional 
practice for a substantial period. In that situation, the <em>Marcus</em> court 
stated, the license "should be deemed to have 
merged with and been subsumed by the practice itself" (id., at 139). The 
underlying rationale is that "the equitable considerations that * * * motivated the <em>O'Brien</em> court are fundamentally 
different" where the license has been utilized for a substantial period to 
establish a career or professional practice and to generate tangible assets for 
the family (<em>Parlow v Parlow</em>, 145 Misc 2d 
850, 856; see, <em>Maher v Maher</em>, 196 AD2d 530, 
531).
<p>In the years since the merger theory was first articulated, the lower courts 
of this State have applied it with varying results. While the theory has repeatedly been 
reaffirmed (see, e.g., <em>Duffey v Duffey</em>, 198 
AD2d 581; <em>Maher v Maher</em>, supra, at 531; 
<em>Kalisch v Kalisch</em>, supra; <em>McGowan v McGowan</em>, 142 AD2d 355, 359 n*; <em>Madori v Madori</em>, 151 Misc 2d 737, affd 201 AD2d 859; 
<em>Vanasco v Vanasco</em>, 132 Misc 2d 227; but see, <em>Holihan v Holihan</em>, 159 AD2d 685), the courts have also found it necessary to make significant 
modifications to address the myriad of situations in which the problem of 
matured professional licenses has arisen. In <em>Shoenfeld v Shoenfeld</em> (168 AD2d 674), for example, the Second 
Department upheld the lower court's holding that a two-year old practice was too 
new to have subsumed the underlying professional 
license. Similarly, in <em>Phelps v Phelps</em> (199 
AD2d 608, 609), the Third Department held that it was not error to assign 
separate distributable value to a medical license 
that had been in use for seven years because the 
licensee had made several changes in the form of 
his practice and his earnings had not yet "stabilized sufficiently to permit a 
valuation of his practice which would truly reflect 
the increased earning capacity [attributable to] his license." In <em>Aborn v Aborn</em> (196 AD2d 561), the Second Department 
declined to apply the merger rule to a spouse's professional license where the 
licensee had dissolved what had once been a 
profitable professional partnership and had relocated his practice several times.
<p>In yet another approach to the problems created by natural professional 
mobility, the lower courts have held that a license 
which has previously "merged" with a professional 
career or practice may "re-emerge" as a significant and separately distributable 
asset if the licensed spouse experiences a significant career change. This 
principle was applied where the licensed spouse sold a longstanding medical 
practice and opened a new one in another State (<em>Behrens v Behrens</em>, 143 AD2d 617; cf., <em>Marano v Marano</em>, 200 AD2d 718) and where a spouse with a law 
license terminated his career as a United States Congressman shortly after the 
matrimonial action was commenced (<em>Martin v 
Martin</em>, 200 AD2d 304). It was also applied, in combination with the 
<em>Shoenfeld</em>-<em>Phelps</em>-<em>Aborn</em> exception, where a licensed attorney 
who had worked as a law assistant for ten years switched to private practice and the four-year history of that practice 
did not "warrant the finding" that the practice had subsumed the license 
(<em>Wells v Wells</em>, 177 AD2d 779).
<p>Yet another variant of the merger rule was 
applied by the Fourth Department in <em>Finocchio v 
Finocchio</em> (162 AD2d 1044) and <em>DiCaprio v 
DiCaprio</em> (162 AD2d 944). The courts in those cases acknowledged the 
applicability of the merger principle but treated the enhanced earning power 
associated with a spouse's professional license as a marital asset anyway. 
Over a vigorous 
dissent, the <em>Finocchio</em> majority reasoned that the merger principle should 
not be applied "in a way which would deprive the 
nonlicensee spouse of * * * any interest [in] the marital asset beyond 
commencement of the matrimonial action" (162 AD2d, at 1045). Accordingly, while 
the spouse's professional license had "merged" into his career, that conclusion 
meant only that the method for valuing the license 
"must include a projection of the licensee's future earnings 'based on actual 
past earnings produced by actual practice'" (id., at 1046, quoting <em>McGowan 
v McGowan</em>, supra, at 359 n*; accord, 
<em>DiCaprio v DiCaprio</em>, supra, at 945). In 
other words, under <em>Finocchio</em> "the only effect of the merger is that the 
court uses the owner's actual earnings to compute the [license's] value instead of using the projected earnings of the 
average professional" (B. Turner, Equitable 
Distribution of Property § 6.19, p 208 [1992 Supp]).
<p>Although the <em>Finocchio</em> approach has much merit, it is ultimately 
flawed because of its continued reference to the concept of "merger." As is 
evident from the case law, the use of that term 
injects an artificial and unnecessarily confusing element into an already 
difficult assessment process.
<p>One objection to the concept of "merger" is that it rests on the notion that 
an unrevoked professional license can somehow lose 
its character as a component of marital property solely because of its use in 
advancing its holder's career. If, as we held in 
<em>O'Brien</em>, a currently valid professional 
license is a distributable item of economic value, 
it should logically retain that quality throughout its existence. It would be 
anomalous to suggest that a marital asset may "merge" or disappear and perhaps 
even "re-emerge" or reappear depending on the vicissitudes of the licensee's professional career (cf., 
Oldham, Divorce, Separation and the Distribution of 
Property § 9.02[1], p 9-11 ["[i]t would be Alice-in-Wonderlandish to say that 
education is property only sometimes"]).
<p>A second objection to the "merger" theory is that it is difficult to apply. 
Even the doctrine's simplest application is 
problematic, since there can be no clear yardstick for measuring when the 
licensee's practice or career has matured to the point where it has "subsumed" 
the license (see, Scheinkman, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons. Laws of 
NY, Domestic Relations Law § 236, C236B:6, p 40 [1995 Supp]). The doctrine's 
proper use becomes even more confusing when it is 
applied to the many situations in which the licensee has experienced career 
reversals, has opted to change professional 
direction or has simply selected a career that does not "square up exactly" with 
the scope of the license (id., pp 40-41).
<p>Finally and most fundamentally, the merger doctrine is flawed because its 
practical effect is to limit the <em>O'Brien</em> rule's application to recently 
acquired licenses (see, <em>DiCaprio v DiCaprio</em>, 
supra, 946-948 [Lawton, J., dissenting]; <em>Marcus v 
Marcus</em>, supra, at 139). Such a narrow approach is inconsistent with 
the equitable goal of assuring both spouses a fair share of all of the assets 
that were produced by the marital partnership. Application of the merger 
doctrine is particularly inimical to the statutory purposes because it generally 
favors the non- licensed spouse in a shorter 
marriage over the non-licensed spouse who is faced 
with rebuilding his or her economic life after the break-up of a long-term 
marriage (see, Scheinkman, op. cit., C236B:6, p 40 [1995 Supp]).
<p>In view of these logical and practical 
difficulties, we conclude that the letter and spirit of our holding in 
<em>O'Brien</em> is best served by eliminating the 
concept of "merger" from the inquiry. The merger doctrine should be discarded in 
favor of a common-sense approach that recognizes 
the ongoing independent vitality that a 
professional license may have and focuses solely on 
the problem of valuing that asset in a way that 
avoids duplicative 
awards. <em>O'Brien</em> permits the court to include in the marital estate the 
present value of any increased earning capacity 
attributable to a professional license earned during the marriage. That 
increased earning capacity continues to exist, to a greater or lesser degree, 
throughout the life of the license. Even after the 
licensee has had the time and opportunity to exploit the license and to realize 
a portion of the enhanced earning potential it affords, the license itself 
retains some residual economic value, although in 
particular cases it may be nominal (see, Turner, op. cit., pp 208-209). That 
value can be measured and distributed just as a 
newly-acquired license is valued through various actuarial techniques that are well known to valuation experts.
<p>To be sure, the valuation inquiry is made more 
complicated by the passage of time and the licensee's harvesting of some portion of the enhanced earning capacity 
that accompanies the license. The value of a 
newly-earned license may be measured by simply comparing the average lifetime income of a college graduate and the 
average lifetime earnings of a person holding such 
a license and reducing the difference to its present value (see, <em>O'Brien v 
O'Brien</em>, supra, at 582; 2 McCahey, Valuation &amp; Distribution of Marital Property § 
30.03[3], p 30-19 through 30- 21). In contrast, where the licensee has already 
embarked on his or her career and has acquired a history of actual earnings, the 
foregoing theoretical valuation method must be 
discarded in favor of a more pragmatic and 
individualized analysis based on the particular 
licensee's remaining professional earning potential (see, <em>Finocchio v Finocchio</em>, supra, at 1045-1046; Scheinkman, op. 
cit., C236B:6, p 48 [1995 Supp]). Moreover, care 
must be taken to ensure that the monetary value 
assigned to the license does not overlap with the 
value assigned to other marital assets that are 
derived from the license such as the licensed 
spouse's professional practice. The courts must also be meticulous in guarding 
against duplication in the form of maintenance awards that are premised on 
earnings derived from professional licenses.
<p>The existence of these complications, however, 
is not a sound reason to introduce nettlesome legal fictions or to excise an 
asset to which the non-titled spouse has contributed from the marital estate. As 
we stated in <em>O'Brien</em>, the complexity of calculating the present value of a partially exploited professional license is no 
more difficult than the problem of computing wrongful-death damages or the loss 
of earning potential that is occasioned by a particular injury (66 NY2d, at 
588). Nor does it lead to significantly more speculation than is involved in the now-routine 
task of valuing a professional practice for the 
purpose of making a distributive award (see, id., 
citing <em>Arvantides v 
Arvantides</em>, 64 NY2d 1033; <em>Litman 
v Litman</em>, 93 AD2d 695, affd 61 NY2d 918; see 
also, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/084_0369.htm"><em>Burns v Burns</em>, 84 NY2d 369</a>, 376-377).
<p>IV.
<p>In this case, no distributive award representing 
the value of defendant's law license was made 
because of the Appellate Division's prior ruling 
that the license had merged with defendant's legal career. This ruling was 
error, since the license had a residual economic value independent of defendant's career. Accordingly, the 
matter must be remitted to the Supreme Court so that a new distribution of the 
marital assets taking into account the value of 
defendant's law license, can be made. Notably, the question of valuation will probably have 
to be tried de novo, since it appears that the 
experts' assessments and the Supreme Court's initial valuation determination were made without compensating 
for the portion of the enhanced earning capacity attributable to the license 
that has already been realized through defendant's legal career (see, Turner, 
op. cit., at 208- 209). However, a full de novo inquiry into the other distributive issues is not necessary, since those issues have already been resolved in 
prior proceedings and, as noted elsewhere in this opinion, we find no basis to 
disturb their disposition in the courts below.
<p>Inasmuch as there must be a new trial on this narrow point, we turn briefly 
to the question of whether the trial court may consider the post-commencement 
events that may have 
affected the value of defendant's license. Of 
course, the most significant of these is defendant's 1992 job loss, which was 
caused in part by what the Appellate Division 
characterized as plaintiff's "acrimonious and vindictive conduct" (208 
AD2d, at 837).
<p>Domestic Relations Law § 236B(1)(c) provides 
that the classification of property as "marital" or "separate" is governed by the date on which the matrimonial action was 
commenced or the parties' separation agreement executed. However, the equitable distribution statute does not specify 
the date that is to be used as the touchstone for measuring the value of the marital property (see, Scheinkman, op. cit., 
C236B:26, p 287). Thus, the appropriate date for measuring the value of marital property has been left to the sound 
discretion of the trial courts, which should make their determinations with due 
regard for all of the relevant facts and 
circumstances (see, Domestic Relations Law § 236B[4][b]).
<p>In attempting to select a suitable valuation 
date, some courts have drawn a distinction between 
"active" assets (i.e., those whose value depends on the labor of a spouse) and "passive assets" (i.e., those whose value depends only on market conditions). These courts 
have concluded that "active" assets should be valued 
only as of the date of the commencement of the action, while the valuation date for "passive" 
assets may be determined more flexibly (see, <em>Smerling v 
Smerling</em>, 177 AD2d 429; <em>Heine v 
Heine</em>, 176 AD2d 77; <em>Zelnik v 
Zelnik</em>, 169 AD2d 317; <em>Kallins v 
Kallins</em>, 170 AD2d 435; <em>Greenwald v 
Greenwald</em>, 164 AD2d 706). Such formulations, however, may prove too rigid to 
be useful in particular cases. Thus, they should be regarded only as helpful 
guideposts and not as immutable rules of law (see generally, Scheinkman, op. 
cit., C236B:26, p 79-80 [1995 Supp]).
<p>Here, for example, defendant's law license would probably be classified as an 
"active" asset in the lower courts' taxonomy. Yet, 
one of the apparent goals of using the date of the action's commencement for 
measuring the assets' worth, i.e., preventing the 
licensed spouse from unilaterally manipulating the asset's value, may not be relevant 
in this case, where the actions of the non-licensed spouse may have undermined the license's residual economic value.
<p>In the final analysis, whether the unusual post- commencement events that led to defendant's job loss should be 
considered in assessing the residual value of his 
law license is a question that lies squarely within the trial court's 
discretion. We hold only that the timing of these events should not by itself be a legal impediment to such 
consideration.
<p>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division 
should be modified, with costs to appellant, and the case remitted to Supreme 
Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and as so modified 
affirmed.
<p>F O O T N O T E
<p><a name=n1a>1.</a> Plaintiff has also argued that the bulk of the marital 
estate should have been awarded to her because a 
considerable portion of it was derived from gifts 
from plaintiff's parents. However, the courts below 
both found that the gifts in question were given 
with an intent to benefit the parties equally and were thus properly included as 
marital property. This conclusion, as well as the Supreme Court's affirmed 
rulings with respect to defendant's maintenance obligation and the distribution 
of certain bonds, were supported by the record and thus there is no basis for 
this Court to intervene.<a
