Falanga ruled in favor of Long Island matrimonial and family law attorney Russell Marnell in the case of C.P. v. G.P. and his argument that the defendant husband socially abandoned the wife and thus meeting the grounds requirement for divorce.</p><p>Citing a 1960 decision in Diemer v. Diemer where the court said that abandonment is a "refusal by one spouse to fulfill the basic obligations springing from the marital contract," Marnell said that the ruling is "really just taking what has been case law, and is looking at it from a different approach. It is very logical to say that when a spouse does not receive the social benefits one typically expects from a marriage that one has been constructively abandoned."</p><p>Marnell represented the plaintiff wife, who alleges that after 36 years of marriage, her husband has socially abandoned her. As described by the New York Law Journal, according to Judge Falanga, since 1993, the husband had refused to take meals with his wife or even eat food prepared by her. He also refused to celebrate holidays with her, did not attend her father's funeral in 1997 or the funeral of her nephew, who was killed in the September 11, 2001 terror attack on the World Trade Center.</p><p>The judge's decision to allow for grounds on the basis of social abandonment allows the case to go forward to trial scheduled to begin on March 14th.  In earlier decisions, the judge refused to find grounds of either sexual constructive abandonment or for cruel and inhuman treatment.</p><p>Under New York State law, those seeking a divorce must establish either abandonment, constructive abandonment, cruel and inhuman treatment, adultery or imprisonment. If a plaintiff does not have grounds for a divorce, the couple could enter into a separation agreement, live separate and apart for one year under the terms of the agreement and then seek to convert the agreement into a divorce decree.</p><p class="center">###</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />Contact: John Zaher<br />(631) 207-1057 or (631) 375-8770</p><p>August 16, 2004</p><h1><a name="081604">The Challenges of Home Ownership and Divorce</a></h1><h2>Rising Prices in Area Posing Challenges for Divorcing Couples</h2><p>(East Meadow - NY) With the median price of a home reaching about $430,000 in Nassau and about $350,000 in Suffolk, Attorney Russell Marnell worries that rising prices is making it more difficult for couples to divorce and may help to make it more difficult for divorcing couples to afford living in the New York Metro area.</p><p>"While rising home values in the New York Metro area has meant larger assets to distribute in divorce, it has also made it difficult for divorcing couples, losing economies of scale, to maintain their standards of living. With real estate prices cooling, these challenges are likely to increase and may pose greater social consequences," said Mr. Marnell.</p><p>According to the Long Island Board of Realtors, the median price for a home in Nassau County is about $430,000, while Suffolk's is about $350,000.  These prices are about double of what they were only five years ago.  While rising prices create greater equity, it is often a couple's largest asset.  During divorce negotiations, several issues often arise with respect to the home. First, are there minor children? With this in mind, should one spouse obtain exclusive use and occupancy until the youngest child graduates from high school, turns 18 or some other agreed upon time?  Second, with the above considered, should the house be sold? Often, one spouse's equity in the home can offset other assets, such as a 401k, pension or savings.  When it doesn't, it is more likely that the home would have to be sold.</p><p>Financially, divorce can often be very difficult for both spouses, as well as for any children of the marriage. The challenge of maintaining two separate households and no longer having the economies of scale marriage provides, generally places both members of the couple in worse financial position than if the marriage had stayed together. With real estate markets at their peak, single persons and young couples often find it challenging to purchase a first home. The same applies to divorcing spouses. In the scenario where one spouse retains the marital home, they may find it difficult to cover the costs of the mortgage and taxes. While the other spouse may have retained other assets, they may be forced to rent or to buy a smaller and less expensive home. At the same time, this spouse may be paying child support and maintenance. In the event the martial home is sold, then both spouses may be forced to downgrade to renting or purchasing smaller homes, co-ops or condos.</p><p>"In recent years, fortunately for divorcing spouses that have remained married for at least a few years, their marital home has generally appreciated in value.  This at least gives them assets to divide and set off with other assets. However, what are the prospects if the real estate market levels off or declines?" asks Mr. Marnell.</p><p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 10% of marriages end by the fifth year. In a stagnant or declining real estate market, divorcing spouses, especially those of shorter marriages will not have accumulated equity and would be forced to sell. They may even face the scenario of selling their home for less than they purchased it.  With spouses now having to maintain two separate homes and perhaps providing child support and maintenance, this could have serious social consequences and result in larger numbers of divorcing spouses being unable to afford homes and the costs of living in this area.</p> <p>"While it may not be possible to find complete solutions to issues of losses of economies of scale in divorce, these factors must be considered when contemplating marriage and divorce.  Attorneys, working with financial advisors can help to develop agreements that will best allow spouses to meet the challenges posed by divorce," said Mr. Marnell.</p><p class="center">###</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />Contact: John Zaher<br />(631) 207-1057 or (631) 375-8770</p><p>May 26, 2004</p><h1><a name="052604">This Spring More Couples Should Consider Prenuptials Before Walking down the Aisle</a></h1><p>(East Meadow ­ NY) With every Spring comes the inevitable parade of brides and grooms exchanging solemn vows of marriage.  While few couples enter marriage anticipating divorce, considering that about 10% of marriages end in divorce by the end of the fifth year, attorney Russell Marnell believes that more couples should consider prenuptial agreements.</p><p>"The decision to create a pre-nuptial agreement is a highly personal one.  Often, one may be reluctant to explore this topic with a prospective spouse out of concern that such a discussion could put a cloud over the marriage and cast doubt on the devotion of the person seeking the agreement.  However, considering that couples are marrying later in life and that divorced spouses are remarrying, I recommend that a couple contemplating marriage consider whether a prenuptial agreement is appropriate for them," said Mr. Marnell.</p><p>An antenuptial or prenuptial agreement is a contract entered into by a couple prior to marriage that seeks to provide a greater degree of certainty and to limit New York's equitable distribution or child support laws.  The agreement must be in writing and must be signed and acknowledged by both parties and will often be sought when there is a disparity in pre-marital separate property or earning power of the couple.  While it can supersede equitable distribution and provide for spousal support, it cannot so limit support that the spouse will become a public charge.  Provided that a prospective spouse did not enter into the agreement under duress, fraud, forgery, overreaching, or the agreement excessively one-sided, then the agreement is generally enforceable in the event of divorce or death of a spouse.  Under New York's Domestic Relations Law, the parties can determine the amount (if any) and duration of maintenance, rather than leaving this issue to a court to decide.  Therefore, when there is a large disparity in income between the parties, it is recommended that the wealthier spouse seek a prenuptial agreement.</p><p>Another trend in our society suggesting the growing need for using prenuptial agreements is the growing number of remarriages often involving persons in their later years with grown children.  Under New York's elective share statute, a surviving spouse is entitled to the greater of $50,000 or one-third of the decedent's estate, regardless of how assets are disposed of in a will. The contemplation of re-marriage can cause concern among grown children, especially when substantial assets are at stake, including a family business or a childhood.  Since prenuptials can include contemplation of death and are also enforceable upon death, they could provide greater certainty by limiting the assets to be left to the surviving spouse and thus accomplishing what a will cannot due to the elective share.</p><p>"While prenuptial agreements are often not an easy topic to discuss, more couples should consider doing so.  If used properly, they can help to reduce fears and uncertainty, while ensuring that spouses and children are properly provided for.  They can also help to reinforce the bonds of trust that the marriage is based on love and not based on the amount of assets and earning potential of a spouse," said Mr. Marnell.</p><p class="center">###</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />Contact:John Zaher<br />(631) 207-1057 or (631) 375-8770</p><p>January 2, 2004</p><h1><a name="010204">Long Island Matrimonial Attorney Expects Additional Divorce Inquiries Following New Year</a></h1><p>(East Meadow ­ NY) While New Year's resolutions are often filled with the common goals of exercising, losing weight and saving money, matrimonial attorney Russell Marnell finds that his office is often busy following the New Year, fielding inquiries from new clients who have resolved to seek a divorce as part of their New Year's resolutions.</p><p>"This is often a busy time of the year for my office.  Over the last few weeks we dealt with a number of cases concerning visitation rights as families made plans for the holidays.  In the weeks to come, we expect an increase in calls from prospective clients who are taking the first steps to learn more about what is involved in obtaining a divorce," said Mr. Marnell.</p><p>Mr. Marnell believes that the combined effect of holiday stress and high expectations we have for our families and our relationships during the holidays may contribute to many persons resolving to pursue a divorce in the New Year.  "We often have this Norman Rockwell conception of the holidays.  At this time of the year, our expectations sometimes end in disappointment.  Compounded by drinking and holiday stress, a couple that is struggling to maintain a marriage may often be prompted to consider divorce as part of one or more of the partner's self-evaluation that comes with the New Year," said Mr. Marnell.</p><p>As Mr. Marnell and his staff field inquiries, they are often placed in the position of a counselor.  His advice is that if a couple has any doubt, then they should err on the side of keeping the marriage together.  He also recommends that someone considering divorce should carefully write out the advantages and disadvantages of remaining married and try to weigh the importance of these factors in making a decision.  Often one of the partners wants to maintain the marriage, but the other does not.  He often recommends marriage counseling and works with marriage counselors and other professionals to assist the couple in the decision making process.  Once a client makes the decision to seek a divorce, Marnell will review the legal and financial considerations with them.</p><p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 2.34 million new marriages in the United States in 1995 (the last year in which statistics are complete) while there were approximately 1.17 million divorces, for the often cited 50% divorce rate.  About 10% of marriages end by the fifth year.  New York is considered one of the more difficult states in which to obtain a divorce.  In 2001, 145,500 New York couples got married while 54,100 marriages ended in divorce.</p><p class="center">###</p><p>For Immediate Release<br />Contact: Janice Garber<br />(516) 542-9000</p> <h1><a name="press1">NASSAU COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION RE-APPOINTS RUSSELL I.
