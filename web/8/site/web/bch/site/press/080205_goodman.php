The ribbon was inspired by the personal fight against breast cancer that has been led by Pace and millions of other afflicted women across Long Island and around the world. The solid metal design resembles the familiar pink ribbon worn by millions to raise awareness and is available for purchase as a pendant, earrings, pin and tie tack for men. The tie tack is especially significant to Goodman, because it helps to symbolize men's awareness of the struggle of women against the disease.</p><p>"I am pleased to have designed this ribbon with the women who have visited my shop over the years who have fought breast cancer in mind.  My donation of 18% is based on the 18th letter of the Hebrew alphabet, "chai" meaning "to life".</p><p>The charm can be purchased by telephone (1-888-898-6789) or through the Breast Cancer Help's website.</p><img src="../images/kgoodman.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="pressimage" alt="Curves 2005 kickoff" /><p>Pictured (from left to right): Sue Muscarello of Manorville, artist Kenny Goodman, the owner of Kenny Goodman Jewelry in Fire Island; and Lorraine Pace, co-president and co-founder of Breast Cancer Help, Inc. show off new silver ribbons that were designed by Goodman to help raise awareness and funds to battle breast cancer.</p><?php include ('pressfooter.php');?>
