(Healthy Environment for a Living Planet) Joins with Cornell Cooperative Extension and the Village of Lindenhurst to Sponsor All-Natural v. Chemical Weed Demonstration Project</h3><p>April 29, 2005</p><p>Breast Cancer Help, Inc. (Healthy Environment for a Living Planet) joined today with Cornell Cooperative Extension Suffolk County and the Village of Lindenhurst to kick-off an environmentally-friendly weed management demonstration.</p><p>The demonstration project will continue through September and will take place on Village maintained property along the Long Island Rail Road right of way. It involves the use of all natural products in side-by-side comparisons with a low-toxicity chemical product used currently by the Village, as well as many other municipalities across Long Island. There will also be a control area, untreated with either natural substances or chemicals. During the course of the study, comparisons will be made and the results made available for the purpose of encouraging government entities and other property owners to use non-toxic, natural alternatives to chemical agents.</p><p>"As our name suggests, our organization has long-supported efforts at identifying potential environmental factors in the fight against breast cancer and other cancers on Long Island. This project is a continuation in those efforts. We are optimistic and hopeful that the results of the demonstration will encourage others to seek environmentally friendly alternatives in weed-control. On Long Island, we love to maintain our lawns and property. But we have a responsibility to our children and future generations to do so in an environmentally-friendly way, "said Lorraine Pace, Co-President of Breast Cancer Help, Inc.</p><p>The project is the product of research and work conducted by Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County in conjunction with a county wide goal to reduce pesticide use. Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County is a non-profit educational agency dedicated to strengthening families and communities, enhancing and protecting the environment, and fostering countywide economic development. Affiliated with Cornell University, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County is part of the state and national extension system that includes the land-grant universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. CCE's program areas include Agriculture, Marine, 4-H Youth Development, and Family and Consumer Sciences.</p><p>"We are pleased to join with Breast Cancer Help and the Village to launch this project. Only through awareness and education can we show the public that there are effective environmentally-friendly alternatives to many of the chemically based products used today in weed control, pest-control and fertilization," said Tom Williams, Executive Director of Cornell Cooperative Extension.</p><p>Like many other municipalities on Long Island, the Village of Lindenhurst is responsible for maintaining property adjacent to roads and relies on low-toxicity chemicals to provide weed control. In joining in the announcement, Village Mayor Tom Brennan said, "We are always working to ensure that our actions as a municipal government are accomplished in a way that is going to have a positive impact on the quality of life of our residents. If we can accomplish the same objectives in an environmentally-friendly way, then it is our obligation to the community and its environment to implement effective alternatives. We eagerly await the results of the study and look forward to working with Breast Cancer Help and Cornell Cooperative Extension on this worthwhile project."</p><p>The demonstration project is posted and is taking place in the area between North 8th Street and Strong Avenue along the Long Island Rail Road's right of way in Lindenhurst.
