During the time period, members will also be provided with awareness information. The funds raised will benefit Breast Cancer Help, Inc. Last year, over $30,000 was raised.</p><p>At an event held on New Year's Eve to launch the weight loss marathon held at Curves of Holbrook, Franchise Co-owners Linda Servedio and Ellena Young welcomed representatives from Curves locations throughout Queens, Nassau and Suffolk. "As women, we are joining here to today to join together and commit ourselves to this program designed to increase awareness and raise funds for an organization dedicated in the fight against breast cancer, while at the same time providing our members with an extra incentive to lose weight as part of building a healthy new year," said Servedio and Young.  They were joined by Claire Sieber, owner of Curves of Syosset, who said, "On behalf of local Curves owners, I am pleased to be part of this special fundraising event with Breast Cancer Help. Both Curves and Breast Cancer Help are committed to promoting women's health, and together through this joint effort, we will empower women to attain a better quality of life through education, risk reduction and treatment."<p>Beginning with the New Year, members of participating Curves wishing to participate will be weighed, measured and determine a goal for the six week marathon. They will then be provided with a sponsor sheet to take to family, friends and neighbors in order to seek pledges based on the amount of weight and/or inches they lose. At the end of the marathon, funds will be collected. At each participating Curves, the member who raises the most funds and the member who loses the most weight will be honored at a ceremony held in March. Throughout the program, breast cancer awareness materials will be provided. Lorraine Pace, Co-President of Breast Caner Help will also be making lecture appearances to discuss breast cancer education and awareness.</p><p>"We thank Curves and the participating owners for joining us in the fight against breast cancer. Considering that eating healthy and exercise is an important part of reducing your risks for breast cancer, it is ideal for us to join with Curves to continue our efforts to increase awareness, find the causes and a cure for breast cancer and ensure that Long Islanders have access to the best possible medical diagnosis and care," said Lorraine Pace.<p>To participate, contact participating local Curves. For more information about Breast Cancer Help, contact (631) 661-7223.</p><?php include ('pressfooter.php');?>
