This site is a grassroots resource for information and activism in the fight against breast cancer. Years of hard work and ongoing effort by breast cancer survivors, their families, friends, and communities has made a serious and positive impact in our fight. Learn about what you can do to win the battle for our bodies and our lives. If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer, get the support you need to help you overcome the challenges presented by your disease.</p><p>While a cure for breast cancer continues to elude us, much has been accomplished to increase awareness and improve the quality of healthcare breast cancer patients receive. We have been able to achieve this by gaining support from local elected officials and raising money through our fundraising efforts.</p><p>Breast Cancer Help, Inc. is a not-for-profit grass roots organizationwith a focus on action and advocacy to eradicate breast cancer. Founded in 1994 by Lorraine Pace, a breast cancer survivor, and Father Thomas Arnao, the group promotes education and awareness of breast cancer issues. Pace was also the founder of the West Islip breast cancer mapping project, which pinpointed breast cancer clusters. This original mapping project, which spearheaded thebreast cancer environmental movement, has now spread to other partsof New York, the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>Since its inception, Breast Cancer Help, Inc. has taken amulti-pronged approach to combating breast cancer. Theorganization has worked to mobilize citizens into breast cancercoalitions leading to breast cancer mapping projects;worked to bring cancer education into our schools; served asadvocates to change state and local laws to preserve our environment;and worked to strengthen the rights of breast cancerpatients. Breast Cancer Help has also worked to ensurethat Long Islanders have access to the best possible medicaldiagnosis and care through the purchase of radiosurgery equipmentand lease of a digital mammography unit at Stony BrookUniversity Hospital.</p><p>In March of 2003, Breast Cancer Help opened its Long Island CancerHelp and Wellness Center. The Center represents a partnershipbetween Breast Cancer Help, Inc. and the Village of Lindenhurst,a municipal government with a long history of support of grassrootsefforts to find the causes and a cure for breast cancer. The goal of the Long Island Cancer Help and WellnessCenter is to provide increased cancer awareness to promoteearly detection, while providing patients and survivors withneeded support.</p><?php include ('footer.php');?>
