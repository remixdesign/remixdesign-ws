We are excited about the comprehensive programs being offered for the Winter Session. These offerings incorporate alternative and integrative modalities that will allow you to be kind to yourself and focus on all aspects of your health and wellness, especially your inner self - both mind and spirit. It is important to recognize that complementary modalities that work in concert with traditional medical treatment are essential to the overall well-being of patients. In particular they help to enhance traditional medical treatment and recognize the necessity of treating the whole person - body, mind, and spirit, rather than merely the disease itself.</p><h2>Cancer Patient and Survivor Support Group</h2><p>Breast Cancer Help, Inc. offers a free support group for patients and survivors of breast cancer and other cancers at its Long Island Cancer Help and Wellness Center.
