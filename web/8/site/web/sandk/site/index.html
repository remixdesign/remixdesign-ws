With over 25 years of combined experience between its partners, the firm has offices in New York City, Mineola, Kings Park and Riverhead.</p><p>Social Security Disability (SSD) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are federal programs that provide disability benefits to individuals who are unable to work.  Oftentimes, clients have difficulty in applying and successfully obtaining benefits from the Social Security Administration.  Once a claim has been approved by the Administration or through a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, the claimant begins to receive monthly social security checks from the federal government as long as the disability lasts.  Minor children of survivors may also continue to receive benefits until they reach that age of eighteen.  For those claims that are successful, Sullivan &amp; Kehoe is compensated from past due benefits at a percentage determined by a judge.</p><p class="heading"><a href="sullivanandkehoebrochure.pdf">Download our Brochure in PDF format (100kb)</a></p><div id="intro"><p class="heading" align="center">Click Play to View Our Commercial<br /><br />  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="300" height="347">    <param name="movie" value="tv.swf" />    <param name="quality" value="high" />    <embed src="tv.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="300" height="347"></embed>  </object></p></div></div><br style="clear:both" />  <div id="footer">    <p class="footer"><a href="about.html">About Our Firm</a> | <a href="areas.html">Areas of Practice</a> | <a href="profiles.html">Attorney Profiles</a> | <a href="ssdlaw.html">Social Security Disability Law</a> |  <a href="why.html">Why Sullivan &amp; Kehoe</a> | <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> | <a href="index.html">Home</a>     </p></div></div></body></html>
