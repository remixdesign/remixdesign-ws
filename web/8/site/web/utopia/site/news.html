Her son serves in the Canada armed forces and her daughter, who fulfilled Ruth's own dream to become a nurse, serves patients in Canada.</p><p>Silva immigrated to the United States 30 years ago, and soon began to pursue her lifelong dream of caring for others.

"Ruth is a mature woman of highest character," one family wrote. "She is warmhearted, trustworthy, reliable and dedicated to her work. She was never too tired or impatient to answer our mother's calls... We are grateful to Ruth not just for caring for, but improving the quality of life for our mother in her final years."</p><p>A trademark of Silva's care has been her interest in the cultural backgrounds of her patients and the use of that knowledge to prepare delicious, yet nutritious, ethnic meals. She also entertains patients with her storytelling abilities and has often visited with patients on her days off. One family compared Silva to a combination of Mary Poppins and Mother Teresa.</p><p>Upon learning that Silva would receive the Aide of the Year Award, the family of Silva's current patient offered its praise. "Ruth is very deserving of all the recognition you can give her," the family said. "She gives the best of care with love, dedication, and utmost competency. We are very blessed to have Ruth as part of our family. Ruth has the patience of a saint, tremendous energy and a cheerful disposition. Her outstanding care has given new life to my mother who, at the age of 97, is doing better than ever, thanks to Ruth."</p><hr /><p>April 13, 2005</p><p class="heading"><a name="041305">Utopia Home Care Opens New East Haven Office</a></p><p class="heading2">Office Opened to Meet Connecticut's<br />Growing Need for Quality Home Health Care Services</p><div class="newsPhotoLeft"><img src="images/news/041305_easthaven.jpg" width="200" height="148" alt="East Haven opening" /><p>Pictured (left-right) are Mike Magarian, Director of Business Development  and Operations, Utopia Home Care; Mary Cacace, Director, East Haven Chamber  of Commerce; Todd Dawid, Administrator, Utopia Home Care; Joanne Mallinson,  President, East Haven Chamber of Commerce; Diane Martinez-Contino, Executive  Vice President; Utopia Home Care; Manuel F.

The programs were designed to recruit and hire older workers for Utopia Home Care's six locations in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Utopia Home Care has also qualified to receive a grant for 2004. It is seeking persons age 55 and older to fill various positions, including those of home health care aide, personal care aide and office staff. Utopia's efforts to recruit mature workers recognizes current labor demands in a rapidly growing home health care field. They are meeting  these demands by hiring older workers who are working later in life or returning to the workforce after retirement.</p><p>"We are pleased to partner with Utopia Home Care. This coincides with our efforts to encourage local businesses to hire mature workers. Utopia Home Care recognizes that older Americans have the necessary skills, commitment and strong work ethic to make a positive contribution to any organization.  We applaud Utopia's efforts to recruit and hire older workers to meet their labor demands," said Elvira Lovaglio-Duncan, program director for The National Council on the Aging.</p><p>As part of its effort to hire older workers, Utopia Home Care sponsors and participates in numerous job fairs and advertises in publications that cater to older Americans. In the coming weeks it is holding open houses with the National Council on the Aging at its various Long Island locations.</p><p>"Recruiting caring and compassionate employees and making them a part of our family-owned business has been the key to our company's successful growth.

Our older workers often come to us with greater experience and a special dedication for caring," said Manuel Martinez, Jr.</p><p>In recent years older workers have decided to work later in life. Due to higher costs of retirement as well as tax changes that allow seniors after age 65 to work while collecting social security benefits without incurring a tax penalty.  At the same time, due to medical advances that allow for more advanced treatment at home, shorter hospital stays and greater life expectancy, providing home health services is one of the fastest growing industries on Long Island and in the country.
