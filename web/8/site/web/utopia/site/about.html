The agency was founded by <strong>Manuel F. Martinez</strong>,the firm's President, and his wife <strong>Angelina</strong>, the Secretary/Treasurer.  Recognizingearly  on the need for providing caregivers in the home, they started out withthe idea of creating a home health care service that treated patients with respect,compassion and dignity. Soon after opening their first office they were joined by their three sons and their daughterto help them expand the company. The company has been recognized three timesas one of Long Island's fastest  growing privately owned companies and is LongIsland's largest minority owned company.</p><table class="photo" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img src="images/photo_about.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" /></td></tr><tr><td><p class="photo">&quot;From the day Mercy began caring for my parents she demonstrated her competence. My husband and I were able to go to work with clear heads, knowing that mom and dad were in the best of care. What she has done for my parents deserves both thanks and recognition. I reccomend her wholeheartedly.&quot;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="photo" align="right">A.K.<br  />Brooklyn, NY</p></td></tr></table><p><strong>Expansion-</strong> The agency has grown dramatically and now has  a total of <strong>20 branch offices</strong> in three states - <strong>New York,  Connecticut and Florida</strong>. There are currently six offices on <strong>Long Island, NY</strong>, three in <strong>NewYork City</strong>, five in <strong>Connecticut</strong>, and six in <strong>Florida</strong>. The first office was opened in Kings Park, NY in 1983 and is now the corporateheadquarters. The five offices in Connecticut are Medicare certified as wellas state licensed.The Connecticut  operation also includes a separate company called UtopiaAssisted Living Services, Inc. that provides services to individual clients in15 statefunded congregate and senior housing units throughout the state.</p><p><strong>Experience-</strong> The company is experienced in every level of home care - whether for accident rehabilitation patients; the chronically ill; the pediatric population; the elderly; the disabled; stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS patients; post-hospital convalescents; and those with short or long term illnesses.</p><p><strong>Training-</strong> Utopia provides free training regularly in most  of its offices for those who want to become certified home health aides. Special  assistance is available for bilingual spanish students. In-service classes and workshops covering a wide range of healthrelated topics are presented in all offices throughout the year as part of eachemployee'songoing training. Many of Utopia's employees are bilingual.</p><p><strong>Quality Assurance-</strong>  Utopia is committed to delivering exceptional  care to all its clients. In  order to assure quality care, a nursing assessment of the client's condition  is performed at the start of services and all caregivers are supervised by  a registered nurse. All 20 offices are state licensed, as well as accredited  by the Joint Commission onAccreditation of Health Care Organizations- a nationally recognized  accrediting  organization which sets quality standards for the home health care industry  and monitors their compliance.

The entire Utopia organization is committed to providing the kind of service that you and your family member are entitled to, without compromise.</p><p>Our staff has been trained to uphold the principles that have made us a leader  in home health care. Even after more than 21 years of rapid growth, we continue  to recognize that every patient  is unique. Maybe there is something a little  extra that we can do for a particular patient. A willingness to do that extra  something is what makes us special.</p><p class="heading">Mission Statement</p><p>Utopia is committed to providing its patients and their families with quality services that demonstrate compassion, professionalism and a dedication to the highest standards. We pledge to honor the patients&rsquo; rights at all times and to assist them in achieving as much independence as possible. We will treat them with dignity and care for them, as we would wish to be cared for ourselves.</p><hr width="300" /><p class="privacy"><a href="privacy.html">Utopia Home Care's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices</a></p><hr width="300" /><div id="footer"><a href="about.html">About Utopia</a> | <a href="locations.html">Locations</a> | <a href="services.html">Services</a> | <a href="careers.html">Careers &amp; Training</a> <br /> <a href="news.html">News &amp; Events </a> | <a href="newsletter.html">Newsletter</a> |<a href="resources.html">Resources</a> |<a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> | <a href="index.html">Home</a></div></div></div></body></html>
