When Dora came to us she had severe mammary tumors that we since have had surgically removed. Dora is now an active Dal ready at a moments notice to play. She is about 6 years old and deafbut that does not stop her from being the sweetest Dal ever. Dora seems to be OK with other dogs but not cats. She leaves her crate with enthusiasm each time she is taken for a walks and has become a favorite with many of our dog walking volunteers. Her tail never stops wagging, she is very friendly and sweet. Dora was great in the bath tub for our volunteer who gave her the traditional welcome to Save-A-Pet bath and grooming. Dora recently participated in the Mt. Sinai homecoming parade and loved all the attention she recieved!</p><p>This pet is up to date with routine shots and altered.</p><h2>Samantha</h2><h3>Dog, Shepherd/Greyhound Mix</h3><p>Size: Medium<br />Age: Adult<br />Sex: Female</p><p>Samantha is a sweet 6 year old shepherd/greyhound mix who was rescued from a local shelter. Samantha can sit on command, likes attention and to be patted. Samatha is a quiet girl who longs for her daily belly rubs. Samantha has been on a few overnights with one of our volunteers. She is the perfect lady in the home and likes to go jogging. Because she is a little shy in new situations we would recommend a home without small children. Samantha can not understand why she has been overlooked for such a long time. She needs to be loved again by a family! Please help to show her what life in a home could be like!</p><p>This pet is up to date with routine shots, altered</p><?php include ('../../includes/footer.php');?>
