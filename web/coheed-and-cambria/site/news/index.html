Matthew Sanchez is a boxer, and was clearly the winner of this one. The injury, fittingly nicknamed a "boxer's fracture", involves the ring finger and small finger of the right hand. The injury requires 3 weeks in a cast and a week or two of physical therapy.</p><p>Brother Matthew has inspired two characters in the Coheed and Cambria concept records; "Matthew" is a son of Coheed and Cambria in the story, and "Inferno" is the brother of Coheed, who is a Prize Fighter and modeled loosely after the younger Sanchez.</p><p>The band will be forced to postpone a portion of their upcoming tour dates in Europe with Thrice. Tickets should be held on to until new dates are announced in the coming week. They can then be refunded or exchanged for the new date. The make up shows will not be with Thrice, however, all shows in the UK will not be affected and will go on as planned.</p><p>The following dates have been postponed.</p><p> 11 Antwerp, Belgium - Hof Der Lo<br />12 Amsterdam, NE - Melkweg<br />13 Hamburg, DE - Grosse Freiheit<br />14 Koln, DE - LMH<br />16 Oslo, NO - Rockerfeller<br />17 Stockholm, SW - Debaser<br />19 Copenhagen, DN - Vega<br />20 Berlin, DE - SO36<br />22 Munich, DE - Backstage<br />23 Vienna, AU - Arena<br />24 Zurich, SZ - Rollstofflager<br />25 Bologna, Itl - Astragon<br />26 Milan, Itl - Transilvania </p><p>Claudio sends his deepest apologies, as does the rest of the band, and promise to make these dates up in February in big style.</p><h4>*corrected* Comic Signings in Chicago &amp; St. Louis!</h4><h5>Posted December 18 2005</h5><p>Claudio will be signing copies of the "Good Apollo" graphic novel and "Second Stage" comics at the following locations.<br />Get there early!</p><p>Chicago, IL<br />Sunday, December 18th<br />12:00PM ­ 1:00PM<br />Chicago Comics<br />3244 n.

It comes with a bonus DVD that features the Welcome Home and Suffering Videos, as well as the 6 MTV Vignettes we did, a mini movie featuring the band and footage from the Good Apollo recording sessions. Also there is a 12 page booklet of live black and white Coheed shots. We know it comes quickly off the heels of the regular release of "Good Apollo", but we feel that the bonus disc is worth the price alone, and hope you do too.</p><h4>COHEED AND CAMBRIA TO TOUR UK AND EUROPE WITH THRICE</h4><h5>Posted November 22 2005</h5><p>We're pleased to announce a Co-headline tour of Europe/UK with our good friends Thrice.</p><p>The bands will trade off closing the shows and Circa Survive will support.</p><p>Check out the performances page for a full list of dates.
