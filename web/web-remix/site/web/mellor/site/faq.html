New choices in living arrangements - domestic partners, unmarried couples, second (and third) marriages, gay and lesbian couples with children - have become common, and yet the laws of New York do not provide protection for families of choice. Now, more than ever, plans must be made so that your choices are made known and fulfilled with respect to issues which arise at times of illness or death.</p><p>Advance planning for illness and death has become imperative for almost every  adult. It is true that the law provides for life's  contingencies and emergencies,  but the law makes broad assumptions about us, which often do not reflect the  realities of our lives. For example, the law assumes that we are married to a person of the opposite  sex; that we have adult children who are mature, responsible, and who get  along with each other; and that, if we have minor children, we will be survived  by those children's other parent.</p><p>If a person does not make his or her choices known, the law steps in and makes choices for you based on these assumptions. Many times the choices the law makes are not the same as those you would make.</p><p>This holds true for many aspects of one's life. Among the issues you must address are:</p><p><em>If you become ill...</em></p><ul><li>Who can visit you in a hospital?</li><li>Who your doctor can discuss your treatment with if you are unable to do so?</li><li>Who can make choices about your treatment if you are unable to do so?</li><li>Who will take care of your affairs and see to it that bills are paid and your finances are in order?</li><li>Who has the authority to apply for government benefits, medical and otherwise, which you might need during your recovery?</li></ul><p>A few simple documents can assure that the people closest to you - the people you choose - are the ones who can act for you. Without these documents, the court may need to appoint a guardian for you - an expensive procedure which may result in a stranger taking over your affairs.</p><p><em>When you die...</em></p><p>No one wants to anticipate his or her death. However, the failure to make appropriate arrangements can result in complications which are costly, time-consuming, and emotionally painful. An estate plan is a gift a person gives to his or her loved ones. Amongthe matters which an estate plan should address are:</p><ul><li>Who will manage the orderly transfer of property?</li><li>Who will be see to it that your personal property is passed to the persons that you wish to have it?</li><li>Who will make funeral and burial arrangements?</li><li>Who will look after your minor children, and who will help your adult children manage their inheritance?</li></ul><p>Without a will or other estate planning device, the law makes these choices. For example, if you should die unmarried and without children, the law states that your parents, if living, should inherit your property. If you die unmarried with children, the law presumes that you wish to divide your estate equally among your children. If your parents are not alive, the law dictates an order of succession - beginning with your brothers and sisters and continuing through your blood lines all the way through to your distant cousins. In this day and age, however, we often define our families differently, giving less weight to blood relationships than we do to friendship, love and affection.</p><p>There are other considerations. For example, the law states that a child is an adult when he or she reaches the age of 18. Many parents, however, do not feel comfortable with the possibility that their children, possibly still in high school, will inherit a substantial amount of money or other property with no oversight on the manner in which the money is managed.</p><p>For those who have more substantial assets, a will or other planning instrument can significantly lower the tax burden, thereby increasing the money available for your family or other beneficiaries.</p><p class="heading2"><a name="executor">What does an executor do?</a></p><p>In order to decide who should be appointed as executor of your will, you should understand what the duties of an executor are. Simply put, the executor presents the will to the proper court so that he or she can be given the power to act, and then gathers up the assets and distributes them according to the wishes as expressed in the will. In addition, the executor can be called upon to settle debts, sell assets, and serve as a mediator if arguments should arise about the appropriate distribution of property.</p><p>In some cases, the executor will be required to file estate tax returns, final income tax returns, and estate income tax returns. In addition, the executor will have to file an Inventory of Assets with the court, setting forth the property which will be passing to the beneficiaries under the will.</p><p>Usually, the executor is active in making decisions with respect to funeral and burial arrangements. This can arise in several ways: sometimes the will sets forth certain wishes of the decedent about these matters, and the executor will then have the duty to carry out these wishes. In other cases, the funeral director will seek out the executor for assurance that the funeral expenses will be paid.</p><p>The executor should be a person who is responsible and at least somewhat knowledgeable in financial matters. In most cases, the executor hires an attorney to present the legal papers to the court and assist in the other duties of estate administration. As a result, it is not necessary that the executor have extensive experience in banking and brokerage transactions, as the attorney will be able to provide the relevant assistance.</p><p>It should also be noted that an executor is entitled by law to be paid for his or her work on the estate.</p><p class="heading2"><a name="children">How can I best provide for my children in the event of my death?</a></p><p>If you die leaving young children and the other parent survives, the law will appoint the other parent as guardian of your children. This is usually fine, but not always. In this age of divorce, second families, single parenting, and co-parenting, it is often essential that a parent give careful thought to who will take care of their children in the event of their death. In addition, one must consider how often both parents are traveling together in airplanes and cars, and the increased likelihood that both parents will die together.</p><p>There are two kinds of guardians - a guardian of the property of a minor, who takes care of the financial aspects; and a guardian of the person of a minor, who has custody of the child. These can be the same person, but need not be. Care must be taken to choose the person or people who are most suited to the responsibilities of caring for the children.</p><p>Without a will, the court will step in and decide who is best suited to raise  your children and manage their money. Often, the  judge is called upon to decide  between battling sets of relatives. Few parents would choose to put their children  through that additional emotional trauma. Having made their wishes known in a will, parents  can be assured that their children will be raised  in the manner that they  choose.</p><p>In addition, the will gives the parent the opportunity to give guidance to the guardian about important issues. For example, the will can provide that it is the wish of the parent that the children be raised in the family home, or that certain kinds of education be provided for the children, or that assets be invested in a particular way.</p><p>The importance of a will to the welfare of children does not end when the children are no longer minors. New York State considers a child to be an adult at age 18. Without a will, all monies due to that child are to be paid to him or her at that time, without supervision. In a will, the parent can provide that the monies be paid out at a later date or be managed for the child until he or she reaches a more mature age.</p><p class="heading2"><a name="property">How can I leave my property to my domestic partner?</a></p><p>Generally, the simplest way to leave property to a domestic partner is with a will. This method has many advantages: a will is inexpensive to obtain; it only goes into effect upon death, leaving the property owner with full ownership rights during life; and probate is generally quick and efficient.</p><p>The major disadvantage of a will is that probate proceedings involve, by law, notice of the contents of the will to the decedent's closest family members. This notice requirement provides a way for the family to attempt to circumvent the terms of the will, a time-consuming and costly process.</p><p class="heading2"><a name="unaccept">What should I do if my family does not accept my relationship with my partner?</a></p><p>Unfortunately, our families do not always approve of our choice of life partner. At times, even if the relationship between our traditional family and our family of choice is cordial, after death the relationship deteriorates. It is important that an estate plan anticipate this possibility and take steps to prevent it.</p><p>This is most easily done by circumventing the probate court and devising methods for the transfer of property which take place automatically at death, such as living wills, Totten trusts, and joint ownership. All of these devices have advantages and disadvantages, and each person's situation must be considered before the decision is made as to which instruments are best suited to a person's needs.</p><p class="heading2"><a name="rights">What rights do I have as a domestic partner in New York State?</a></p><p>In matters of inheritance, a domestic partner is not protected under the current New York State laws. The intestate (death without a will) laws of New York define the persons entitled to take the property of a person who dies without a will. The list of people begins with the surviving spouse, and then follows the blood lines through children, parents, brothers and sisters, nieces, nephews, and cousins.</p><p>At times of illness, a domestic partner is often unable to step into the shoes of the ailing partner and take care of things we expect our family to manage. You may find that a hospital denies visitation rights to a domestic partner; medical professionals will not discuss the condition or treatment with the domestic partner; or that the domestic partner cannot apply for benefits, make health care choices, or obtain money to pay bills. All of these issues can be dealt with - but it must be done in advance, lest the patient be unable to sign the appropriate documents.</p></div></div></body></html>
