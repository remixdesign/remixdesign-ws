If the decedent left a will, the executor will need to file certain papers in the probate court in order to have the power to make transfers in ownership. Probate proceedings in New York are usually quick and simple. However, there are many complications that can arise, and it is advisable for a person who has been named executor of a will to seek legal assistance.</li><li>Jointly Held Property. If the survivor owned property with the decedent, the property passes by operation of law to the survivor. In order to record the transfer, however, there is usually a great deal of paperwork. The first step is to contact the recording office (for real property) or the bank or financial institution involved to see what needs to be done. While the process is usually not complicated, many people find it helpful to seek assistance so that the process runs quickly and smoothly.</li><li>Property held in Trust. The terms of the trust determine what happens to the property on the death of the beneficiary of the trust. No matter what provisions have been made, there is a certain amount of paperwork that must be completed to fulfill the terms of the trust.</li><li>Intestacy. If the decedent made no provision for the transfer of his or her property, then the laws of intestacy apply. The law determines who inherits the property and who can act as administrator of the estate. The Surrogate's Court has jurisdiction and supervises the administration of the estate.</li></ol><p>In addition to the transfer of property, the survivor must deal with the issue of estate taxes, the possible need for appraisals, the sale of assets, payment of debts, and questions regarding funeral and burial arrangements. Legal assistance can lessen the burden of all of these issues and make the transition easier.</p></div></div></body></html>
