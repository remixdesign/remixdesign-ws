Should you or your partner become ill, you may find it difficult to participate in health care decisions, handle financial matters, consult with health care professionals, or assist in obtaining needed government and/or insurance benefits because you have not established the legal status to act in this manner. Should you or your partner die when you have not taken the appropriate steps, your partner will have no power to participate in funeral and burial arrangements and will have no right to inherit your property.</p><p>The law presumes that we are all married to people of the opposite sex, have been married once, have one or more children, and that we all get along. If you are part of a traditional family, many of the choices that need to be made in an emergency have been made for you by the law, and usually those choices are in agreement with what you, yourself, would wish. For example, if you are very ill, your spouse and children can visit you in the hospital; if you die, your spouse will inherit your property, and if you survive your spouse and your children will be the beneficiaries of your estate.</p><p>The fact is that many of us are in relationships which do not fit into these neat boxes. We are in same-sex relationships, or have been married more than once, or have never been married, or are estranged from one or more of our children, or have children from more than one marriage. If your situation is not of the type that the law has presumed, it is essential that you execute a series of documents to ensure that matters concerning your health, property, and death will be handled in the manner which you choose, and not according to the presumptions of law.</p><p>Among the documents you must have are:</p><ol type="a"><li>Health Care Proxy. In this document, you decide who will be able to make medical decisions for you in the event you are unable to do so.</li><li>Living Will. This document is used to set forth, in detail, your wishes and desires with respect to the procedures and treatments in connection with serious illness.</li><li>Power of attorney. This document is essential to appoint someone to take  care of your property should you be unable  to do so. Even if all of your property  is in a joint name with another, you need a power of attorney so that your  appointee can apply for medical benefits, transfer property, obtain medical records,  deal with tax and real estate  issues, and conduct other business for you.  Without a power of attorney, it is possible that the court will appoint a guardian for you. This is often an expensive procedure that could put a stranger  in charge of your affairs.</li><li>H.I.P.A.A. medical authorization release. This new federal law has greatly restricted the ability of your family and friends to obtain medical information about you. Should you be unable to make medical decisions for yourself, it is essential that members of your family be permitted access to these materials so that those decisions can be made intelligently.</li><li>Last Will and Testament or Substitute. Traditionally, property passes through a will, which must be probated, to those persons or charities you select. In many situations, the will is the simplest and most efficient way to do this. A will is essential if you have minor children, for it is in a will that you appoint the person or persons who will take care of your children if you die. There are several alternatives to a will, each designed to meet specific situations. You should be aware of the alternatives, and then select the one most appropriate for your needs.</li></ol><p>In addition, there are many other documents available to meet your possible needs: Domestic Partnerships, Co-parenting Agreements, Revocable Intervivos Trusts, Irrevocable Intervivos Trusts.</p></div></div></body></html>
