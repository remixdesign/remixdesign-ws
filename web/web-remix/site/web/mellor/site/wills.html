New choices in living arrangements - domestic partners, unmarried couples, second (and third) marriages, gay and lesbian couples with children - have become common, and yet the laws of New York do not provide protection for families of choice. Now, more than ever, plans must be made so that your choices are made known and fulfilled with respect to issues which arise at times of illness or death.</p><p>Advance planning for illness and death has become imperative for almost every  adult. It is true that the law provides for life's  contingencies and emergencies,  but the law makes broad assumptions about us, which often do not reflect the  realities of our lives. For example, the law assumes that we are married to a person of the opposite  sex; that we have adult children who are mature, responsible, and who get  along with each other; and that, if we have minor children, we will be survived  by those children's other parent.</p><p>If a person does not make his or her choices known, the law steps in and makes choices for you based on these assumptions. Many times the choices the law makes are not the same as those you would make.</p><p>This holds true for many aspects of one's life. Among the issues you must address are:</p><p><em>If you become ill...</em></p><ul><li>Who can visit you in a hospital?</li><li>Who your doctor can discuss your treatment with if you are unable to do so?</li><li>Who can make choices about your treatment if you are unable to do so?</li><li>Who will take care of your affairs and see to it that bills are paid and your finances are in order?</li><li>Who has the authority to apply for government benefits, medical and otherwise, which you might need during your recovery?</li></ul><p>A few simple documents can assure that the people closest to you - the people you choose - are the ones who can act for you. Without these documents, the court may need to appoint a guardian for you - an expensive procedure which may result in a stranger taking over your affairs.</p><p><em>When you die...</em></p><p>No one wants to anticipate his or her death. However, the failure to make appropriate arrangements can result in complications which are costly, time-consuming, and emotionally painful. An estate plan is a gift a person gives to his or her loved ones. Amongthe matters which an estate plan should address are:</p><ul><li>Who will manage the orderly transfer of property?</li><li>Who will be see to it that your personal property is passed to the persons that you wish to have it?</li><li>Who will make funeral and burial arrangements?</li><li>Who will look after your minor children, and who will help your adult children manage their inheritance?</li></ul><p>Without a will or other estate planning device, the law makes these choices. For example, if you should die unmarried and without children, the law states that your parents, if living, should inherit your property. If you die unmarried with children, the law presumes that you wish to divide your estate equally among your children. If your parents are not alive, the law dictates an order of succession - beginning with your brothers and sisters and continuing through your blood lines all the way through to your distant cousins. In this day and age, however, we often define our families differently, giving less weight to blood relationships than we do to friendship, love and affection.</p><p>There are other considerations. For example, the law states that a child is an adult when he or she reaches the age of 18. Many parents, however, do not feel comfortable with the possibility that their children, possibly still in high school, will inherit a substantial amount of money or other property with no oversight on the manner in which the money is managed.</p><p>For those who have more substantial assets, a will or other planning instrument can significantly lower the tax burden, thereby increasing the money available for your family or other beneficiaries.</p></div></div></body></html>
