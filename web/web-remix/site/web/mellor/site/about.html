Ms. Mellor graduated cum laude from New York Law School in 1974.  She is a member of the New York State Bar, United States District Court for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, and the United States Court of Appeals Second and Third Circuits.</p><p>Ms. Mellor has authored legal texts on various topics of criminal law and served as an Adjunct Sociology Professor at Bloomfield College for over 10 years. She has worked as an advocate and litigator for those who have been discriminated against. These experiences and her knowledge of the legal challenges faced by non-traditional families, including gay and lesbian couples, has prompted her to devote a portion of her practice towards assisting these persons in protecting themselves against presumptions made by the law. She works with her clients to develop comprehensive plans using legal documents to ensure that they have planned for the future and that their wishes are carried out.</p></div></div></body></html>
