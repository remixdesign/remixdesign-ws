Okrent, Managing Attorney, and Claudia T. Salazar, 2nd Year Associate</h2><p>The new Medicare Part D prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006.  Almost 3 million Medicare beneficiaries in New York State will  be affected by the new prescription drug benefit.  Medicare Part D will be available to all Medicare beneficiaries through over 40 prescription plans offered through private companies. There are rules and specific deadlines beneficiaries must be aware of.</p><p>All Medicare beneficiaries must make decisions regarding a Part D plan. Medicare beneficiaries that will not require Part D are those with "creditable coverage" through a former employer or other private insurance. Creditable coverage means coverage that is as good as or better than the standard Medicare prescription drug benefit.  Medicare beneficiaries have received notices from their health plans indicating whether they have creditable coverage. If coverage is creditable, beneficiaries should compare their plans to the Medicare Part D plans to determine which plan is the best choice. Beneficiaries may keep the coverage they have or enroll in a Medicare Part D plan. If they decide to enroll into a Medicare Part D plan, they must do so during the initial enrollment period to avoid any penalties discussed below.</p><img src="images/medicine.jpg" width="250" height="167" class="right" alt="photo of medicinal pills" /><p>Though enrollment in a Medicare Part D program is voluntary, those Medicare beneficiaries without creditable coverage who fail to enroll in a Part D plan within the appropriate enrollment period will likely not have Medicare prescription drug coverage for a period of time. Additionally, they will incur a late enrollment penalty for each month that they do not have creditable coverage. This penalty is equal to 1% of the base premium for each month without creditable drug coverage. Thus, Medicare beneficiaries without creditable coverage should review the Medicare plans to determine which plan fits their needs. Those with creditable coverage may decide to later enroll in a Medicare prescription plan and will not pay a penalty if they hold creditable coverage more than 63 days before they enroll in a Medicare Part D Plan.</p><p>Medicare beneficiaries who also receive Medicaid will have their existing Medicaid drug coverage replaced by Medicare Part D plans. These individuals were assigned to a random Part D plan in October 2005. If these beneficiaries did not switch to another Medicare Part D plan by December 31, 2005, the assignment became enrollment.</p><p>Medicare Part D provides prescription drug coverage to millions of Americans who did not have benefits, however it is necessary for beneficiaries to carefully review the alternatives and decide which plan best fits their medical needs.</p><h1><a name="2">Take Control Of Your Medical Wishes</a></h1><p>The Supreme Court has held that an individual has a constitutional right to make decisions regarding his or her own medical treatment, including the right to refuse life sustaining treatment.</p><p>In New York State, two types of advance directives have become extremely valuable tools in planning for possible incapacity: The health care proxy and the living will.</p><div class="blue right"><h3>Ask David</h3><img src="images/askdavid.jpg" width="100" height="153" alt="Okrent photo" /><p>Q. In light of proposed changes in Medicaid eligibility laws, do I need to transfer funds now?</p><p>A. There will still be planning opportunities under the new law. However, clients are encouraged to complete pending transfers before the end of the month.</p></div><h3>Health Care Proxy</h3><p>New York State has codified the right of an individual to designate an agent to make medical decisions on his or her behalf in article 29-C of the N.Y. Public Health Law. The health care proxy is defined as a document which delegates the authority to another adult known as a health care agent to make health care decisions on behalf of the adult when that adult is incapacitated. The document must be executed when a person is competent. An agent's authority is valid only during periods of temporary or permanent decisional incapacity of the principal. The health care agent "stands in the shoes of the principal" and exercises the principal's right to grant or refuse consent to medical treatment. If the principal's wishes are known, either through written directions in the health care proxy or a separate living will, or from conversations with the agent, then the agent's actions must be consistent with those wishes, including the principal's religious and moral beliefs. If the agent does not have a reasonable idea as to the principal's wishes on a particular issue, and cannot with reasonable effort discover them, then the agent must attempt to make health care decisions based on the principal's best interest." The health care proxy should state wishes regarding artificial nutrition and hydration.</p> <h3>Living Will</h3><p>In New York State there is no statutory authority supporting the use of a living will. The Court of Appeals of New York though has strongly endorsed it use. The rationale for the Court's decision is that verbal statements are often too general and do not provide adequate proof to outweigh the state's interest in preserving the rights of individuals who are unable to make decisions for themselves.</p><p>With the enactment of the health care proxy statute, the living will has been relegated to somewhat second choice. However, a well drafted Living Will is still recommended in conjunction with a health care proxy. It gives the agent named in the health care proxy guidance and in the event the agents are unavailable, it will have the "clear and convincing evidence" required by the Court of Appeals to make sure your wishes are followed.</p><div class="blue"><h3>Checklist</h3><h1 class="white"><a name="3">How to Make A Strong Will</a></h1><p>Reviewing your will periodically is a necessary part of your estate plan.</p><img src="images/couple1.jpg" width="250" height="163"  class="left" alt="elderly couple" /><p>Executing a will is one of the most important steps in estate planning. However, wills need to be reviewed periodically to ensure that the wishes expressed in the document comply with your present financial and family situation. The following is a checklist of some of the questions that should be asked to determine if you should revise your will or add a codicil or amendment to it:</p><ul type="square"><li>Has a beneficiary died, taken ill or become disabled?</li><li>Has the structure of your assets changed?</li><li>Have you retired?</li><li>Have you married or divorced?</li><li>Have you welcomed a new child or children to the family?</li><li>Is there a supplemental needs trust included with your will?</li><li>Have the tax laws changed?</li><li>Have you ensured that you have listed the beneficiaries to whom you want assets left?</li><li>Have children predeceased?</li><li>Is your executor living and are they in good health?</li></ul>Once those questions are answered, you should also:<ul type="square"><li>Review your assets to avoid probate litigation.</li><li>Make sure your affairs are efficently organized.</li></ul></div><h3>Law Firm Profile: Featured Attorney</h3><h1><a name="4">David R.
