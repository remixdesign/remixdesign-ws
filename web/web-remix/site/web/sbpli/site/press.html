Friendly Competition define SBPLI-LI FIRST Deer Park Invitational Preseason Event</h5><h6>Competition Highlights Benefits of School Robotics Programs For Students</h6><p>A spirit of cooperation and teamwork permeated the gymnasium at Deer Park High School on Saturday, September 24, 2005 as robots took center court during the Deer Park Invitational, a preseason robotics competition sponsored by the School Business Partnerships of Long Island. Friendly competition coaxed problem solving skills and stellar sportsmanship from the twelve high school teams, including one team from Brooklyn, creating an engaging learning environment focused on the science of physics and the field of engineering.</p><p>In recent years, the School Business Partnership of Long Island, Inc. has held its preseason LI FIRST robotics competition at the Long Island Business and Technology Center in Great River. This year, that event was supplanted by the Deer Park Invitational, which was designed and implemented to showcase the benefits of robotics programs on students, schools and their communities. Participating teams utilized the robots they built for the 2005 regional competition, held at Hofstra University in March. Students navigated their robots to place tetrahedrons (polyhedrons with four faces) onto triangular goals, participating in qualifying rounds during the morning, followed by elimination rounds in the afternoon.</p><p>Residents, teachers and administrators from Deer Park and other Long Island school districts attended the event which included many matches featuring rookie drivers preparing for the 2006 regional competition. So inspired by the event's success Deer Park Superintendent Richard Organisciak has pledged future support for the program.</p><p>The final round, to determine the best two out of three, proved very exciting as each alliance had taken a match.</p><p>The Invitational Winner was the alliance of teams from Miller Place, Hauppauge and Brooklyn. The Invitational Finalist was \the alliance of teams from Deer Park, Plainview-Old Bethpage, and Miller Place.</p><p>The fledgling teams from Freeport and Comsewogue competed in matches with robots from Plainview-Old Bethpage and Miller Place respectively.</p><p>"We planned this event not only as a competition about the design and building of sophisticated robots, but as an opportunity to create an atmosphere whereby students can also develop maturity, professionalism, teamwork and mentoring skills, thereby enriching their lives. We were not disappointed," said Fred Breithut, founder of School-Business Partnerships of Long Island, Inc. "More than once during this competition every team exhibited what one spectator termed as "gracious professionalism", with one team even going do far as to spend precious time trying to right the toppled robot of a competing team."</p><p>"It was wonderful to have been able to provide an opportunity to include rookie teams, giving them a chance to gain practical experience, while competing with veteran teams, "said Janet Anderson, director of the LI FIRST robotics program. She continued, "It is always our hope that students will be inspired to turn their affinity for science and math into a career path, leading them to study engineering, technology or science in college."</p><p align="center">###</p><p><a name="080205_2">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</a><br />John Zaher, PRMG<br />(631) 207-1057<br />(631) 375-8770<br />Fred Breithut<br />(631) 692-2962</p><p>August 2, 2005<br /><h5>SBPLI-LIRST Regional Robotics Competition Development Council Welcomes Steve Stern as a New Member for 2005-6</h5><p>The School- Business Partnerships of Long Island (SBPLI), sponsor of the Long Island Regional FIRST Robotics Competition, recently welcomed new members to its 2005-6 Development Council.

The competition will be       held on March 18-20 at Suffolk County Community College's Michael       J. Grant Campus in Brentwood. Suffolk County Community College is the host       and major supporter of the event. The students will compete for honors and       recognition that reward design excellence, competitive play, sportsmanship       and high-impact partnerships among schools, businesses and communities.</p><p class="indent">FIRST was founded by inventor Dean Kamen, who first introduced the Segway&#8482;       Human Transporter (HT) two years ago. He created FIRST with a goal to inspire       an appreciation of science and technology in young people, their schools       and communities. Currently in its sixteenth year, the FIRST Robotics Competition       will expand its reach to over 23,000 students representing approximately       930 teams from almost every state in the U.S. and abroad. More than 1,000       students will compete in the Long Island Regional to earn a spot at the       Championship to be held April 15-17 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA.</p><p class="indent">&#8220;The FIRST Robotics Competition is not just about the design and building       of sophisticated robots. These students also develop maturity, professionalism,       teamwork and mentoring skills that enrich their lives,&#8221; said Fred       Breithut, President of School-Business Partnerships of Long Island (SBPLI)       and sponsor of the Long Island FIRST Regional Robotics Competition. &#8220;Many       of our students develop an affinity for their science and math courses,       go on to study engineering, technology or science in college, and also pursue       employment opportunities with sponsoring companies.&#8221;</p><p class="indent">Over a six-week timeframe students work with their professional mentors       to design a robot that solves a problem using a &#8220;kit of parts&#8221;       and a standard set of rules. Once these young inventors create their 130       pound robots, their teams participate in regional competitions that measure       the effectiveness of each robot, the power of collaboration and the determination       of students. Students received their kit of parts on January 10th and have       until February 21st to complete their robot. This year's competition       is a game called &#8220;First Frenzy: Raising the Bar,&#8221; which takes       place on a playing field with a mix of robot and human players. Robots and       humans alike can earn points by throwing balls into goals, and extra points       will be given to the team who ends up with their robot hanging from the       pull-up bar in the center of the field.</p><p class="indent">Since its beginning, FIRST has had a positive impact on students and academic       communities. Surveys conducted by the Center for Essential Management Services       found that participating students' attitudes about science, math,       teamwork and the working world significantly improved after participating.       The students' self image also improved, particularly among minority       groups. Also, interest in internship and employment opportunities with sponsoring       local companies increased.</p><p class="indent">This season, participating FIRST students are also eligible to apply for       over $1.75 million in scholarships from leading universities, colleges and       companies that will be announced at the FIRST Championship in April. At       the 2003 national championships, Long Island students walked away with over       $400,000 in college scholarships. In 2003, Longwood CSD won the Chairman's       Award, which is the competition's most prestigious award because it       recognizes the team that embodies the goals and purpose of FIRST and best       represents a model for other teams to emulate.</p><p class="indent">SBPLI was founded in 1984 by its President, Fred Breithut, with the goal       of developing partnerships between local high schools and businesses that       would provide students with practical experience, while helping the business       community develop its future workforce. Over 70 partnerships have been formed.       In 1999, Long Island FIRST was formed for the purpose of developing a Long       Island Regional FIRST Robotics competition. The Long Island Regional has       since grown with 37 teams registered for the 2004 competition. The increase       in participation among high school students and local business demonstrates       the importance of supporting the Long Island Regional FIRST Robotics Competition. </p><p class="indent">The SBPLI &#8211; L.I. FIRST sponsors and volunteers come from some of the       most highly regarded companies and organizations in the Long Island region.       This year's Co-Sponsors are New York State Senator Owen Johnson, FESTO       and SBPLI. Suffolk County Community College is the host and major supporter       of the event. Other major sponsors include J.P. Morgan Chase, EDO, School       Construction Consultants, Hofstra University, Stony Brook University, Stalco       Construction, Park East Construction.</p><p class="indent">FESTO, a major local corporation and continual supporter provides mentors       to a number of local teams. &#8220;We have found that this competition truly       works to inspire our young people to pursue careers in the engineering field.       The students of today are the workforce of tomorrow.

Over 1000 students from thirty-five Long Island School Districts         attended the event at Suffolk County Community College, Brentwood. The         results, over the last three years, continue to indicate that students         are more likely to pursue engineering and science related career directions         after they completed the robotics program.</p><p class="indent">The competition challenges students to design and build an original robot,         working with professional mentors, that solves a problem using a &#8220;kit         of parts&#8221; and a standard set of rules. Once these young inventors         create the robot, their teams participate in regional competitions that         measure the effectiveness of each robot, the power of collaboration, and         the determination of students. &#8220;The FIRST Robotics Competition is         not just about the design and building of sophisticated robots. These         students also develop maturity, professionalism, teamwork, and mentoring         skills that enrich their lives,&#8221; said Fred Breithut, President of         School-Business Partnerships of Long Island (SBPLI) and coordinator of         the Long Island FIRST Regional Robotics Competition. &#8220;Many of our         students develop an affinity for their science and math courses, go on         to study engineering, technology or science in college, and also pursue         employment opportunities with sponsoring companies.&#8221;</p><p class="indent">The results from the evaluation were based on surveys given both before         and after the competition. The assessment, conducted by the Center for         Essential Management Services, found that participating students'         attitudes about science, technology and the working world significantly         improved after participating as did their confidence in managing future         school and career challenges. Also, interest in internships and employment         opportunities with sponsoring local companies increased.</p><p class="indent">An essential element of the competition is its focus on teamwork and problem         solving. However, this year, as opposed to prior years, students had a         slightly less interest in working on teams, although they all seemed to         agree that it was one of the most important skills in life skills to learn.         According to the researchers, Dave Vandergoot, Ph.D. and Kristie Golden,         of the Center for Essential Management Services and members of the LI         FIRST Development Council, &#8220;A possible reason for the decline of         interest in teamwork is the difficulty this past year that many teams         had in raising funds and resources for the varied activities associated         with the competition. Designing and building the robot is a fun challenge         but doing it with inadequate resources adds increased complexity and frustration,         thus straining capability for teamwork. Yet, learning how to work with         less is an important experience in its own right.&#8221;</p><p class="indent">As with previous years, results show that students were well satisfied         with the competition. Students indicated an increase in self-esteem and         assertiveness, reinforcing the value of mastering technology in today's         world. The LI FIRST Robotics Competition brings out the best in students         in many different and important ways.</p><p class="indent">The competition challenged students to design and build an original robot,         working with professional mentors, that solves a problem using a &#8220;kit         of parts&#8221; and a standard set of rules.
