John Peter Tropea, Appellant.<br />In the matter of Jacqueline Browner, Respondent, v. Andrew Kenward, Appellant.</h2><h3>March 26, 1996</h3><p> In each of these appeals, a divorced spouse who was previously granted custody of the couple's minor offspring seeks permission to move away from the area in which the noncustodial spouse resides. Both noncustodial spouses oppose the move, contending that it would significantly reduce the access to the children that they now enjoy. Their respective appeals from the Appellate Division order and the Family Court judgment authorizing the requested moves raise significant questions regarding the scope and nature of the inquiry that should be made in cases where a custodial parent proposes to relocate and seeks judicial approval of the relocation plan.</p><p><a href="#" onclick="window.open('law/032696_tropea.php', 'law', 'width=500, height=350, left=150, top=50,status=0,scrollbars=1,resizable=1')">Full Document</a></p><h2>Hedy L. McSparron, Appellant, v. James G. McSparron, Respondent.</h2><h3>December 7, 1995</h3><p>In <em>O'Brien v O'Brien</em> (66 NY2d 576), this Court held that a professional license acquired two months before the commencement of the matrimonial action was marital property subject to equitable distribution under Domestic Relations Law § 236B. Since that decision, the courts of this State have struggled with the problems involved in distributing the value of older professional licenses that have been utilized in the development of their holders' careers. The primary question presented by this appeal is whether a license that has been exploited by the licensee to establish and maintain a career may be deemed to have "merged" with the career and thereby lost its character as a separate distributable asset.</p><p><a href="#" onclick="window.open('law/120795_mcsparron.php', 'law', 'width=500, height=350, left=150, top=50,status=0,scrollbars=1,resizable=1')">Full Document</a></p><h2>In the matter of Maryann Cassano, Respondent, v. Dominick Cassano, Appellant.</h2><h3>Decided May 9, 1995</h3><p>The focus of this appeal is the Child Support Standards Act (Family Court Act &sect; 413; Domestic Relations Law &sect; 240), which includes a numeric formula for calculating the award of child support, prescribing criteria as to combined parental income under $80,000 and criteria as to income above that amount. We are asked to review an award determined by application of the statutory formula to combined parental income exceeding $80,000. We conclude that the award was proper and affirm the Appellate Division order so holding.</p><p><a href="#" onclick="window.open('law/050995_cassano.php', 'law', 'width=500, height=350, left=150, top=50,status=0,scrollbars=1,resizable=1')">Full Document</a></p><p class="disclaimer">Please read our disclaimer:<br />If there are any problems with this site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@marnelllaw.com?subject=MarnellLaw.com">info@marnelllaw.com</a> We welcome any suggestions for new links and to improve the site.
