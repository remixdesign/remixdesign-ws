We have two children. What are our options in terms of custody?"</strong></p><p>Answer:</p><p>There are several options. The most common scenario is that one of the spouses will have sole custody of the children. That means that both children will primarily reside with one of the parents who will be responsible for making all of the major decisions for the children such as education, medical and religion. The other parent will receive visitation rights with the children.</p> <p>Another option is joint custody. This means that the children will still primarily reside with one of the parents and the other parent will have visitation rights. However, all of the major decisions pertaining to the children will be made jointly by both of the parents.</p> <p>A third option is shared parenting. This means that the children will divide their residence between the parents, with each of the parents having the children in their home approximately 50 percent of the time. In general, all major decisions would be made jointly as with joint custody.</p> <p>There are several variations on the above scenarios. For example, it is possible, although not advisable for the parent who does not have physical custody to be the sole decision maker. Another scenario would be for the children to each reside with a different parent. However, it is typically not wise to split up the children.</p><p><strong>Question:<br />"My spouse has a pension with his employer. He is 35 years old and cannot obtain the proceeds from his pension until he retires. If we get divorced, am I entitled to any portion of his pension?"</strong></p><p>Answer:<br /><p>Yes, Even though your spouse won't obtain these pension funds until his retirement, the New York Courts still classify them as marital assets. However, the entire value of the pension is not necessarily considered a marital asset. Thus, only that portion of the pension which accumulated during the marriage (from the date of the marriage until the commencement date of the divorce action) is considered a marital asset. To calculate the amount of the pension which is marital, the present value of the pension is multiplied by what is known as a coverture fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total number of years the spouse participated in the pension plan while married. The denominator represents the total number of years in the pension plan.</p><p><strong>Question:<br />"I received an inheritance during the marriage. I am now getting a divorce. Is my spouse entitled to any portion of my inheritance?"</strong></p><p>Answer:<br /><p>That depends. In general, an inheritance is a spouse's separate property, and is not considered marital property for the purpose of equitable distribution. However, in order for property or money obtained as part of an inheritance to definitively be considered a spouse's separate property, it cannot be placed into a joint account or in an account in the other spouse's name, cannot be mixed with marital funds and in the event of real property, it cannot be transferred into the other spouse's name and the other spouse's name cannot be placed on the property.</p><p><strong>Question:<br />"I recently moved to New York.  I want to seek a divorce.  Have I lived in New York long enough to obtain a divorce?"</strong></p><p>Answer:<br /><p>That depends on the factual circumstances of your situation. There are certain residency requirements which must be satisfied prior to being able to obtain a divorce in the state of New York. For example, in order to maintain an action for divorce, separation or annulment in New York, the following residency requirements must be met:</p> <ol><li>The parties were married in New York and either party is a resident of the state when the action is commenced and has been a resident of New York for a continuous period of one year immediately proceeding the action; or</li><li>The parties have resided in the state of New York as husband and wife, and either party is a resident of the state when the action is commenced and has been a resident of New York for a continuous period of one year immediately  proceeding the action; or</li><li>The grounds for divorce occurred in New York and either party is a resident of the state when the action is commenced and has been a resident of New York for a continuous period of one year immediately proceeding the action; or</li><li>The grounds for divorce occurred in New York and both spouses are residents of New York at the time the action is commenced; or</li><li>Either party has been a resident of New York for a continuous period of at least two years</li></ol><p><strong>Question:<br />"My husband and I aren't in love anymore. We both want to get a divorce. I have heard that New York requires grounds in order to get divorced.  Is this true? If so, what are the grounds for divorce in New York?</strong></p><p>Answer:<br />Yes, it is true. New York does require grounds in order to get divorced. There is no such thing as obtaining a divorce in New York based upon irreconcilable differences. In order to obtain a divorce in New York, a spouse is required to allege one or more of the following: adultery, cruel and inhuman treatment, abandonment for a period of one or more years, constructive abandonment (lack of sexual relations) for a period of one or more years, confinement of one of the spouses in prison for a period of three or more consecutive years, or both spouses having lived separate and apart pursuant to a decree or judgment of separation or pursuant to a written separation agreement. The Court can compel the parties to remain married in the event one of the spouses contests the divorce and the other is unable to demonstrate the existence of grounds for a divorce, or in the event the Court on its own initiative believes that one of the spouses has failed to prove that grounds for divorce are present.</p><p class="disclaimer">Please read our disclaimer:<br />If there are any problems with this site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@marnelllaw.com?subject=MarnellLaw.com">info@marnelllaw.com</a> We welcome any suggestions for new links and to improve the site.
