Marnell, P.C. concentrates its practice in matrimonial, family, and elder law in the Long Island and New York metro areas. We are a top-rated "AV" firm providing excellent client represenation for over 20 years. Founded in 1985, Mr. Marnell and his lawyers have sought to provide excellent representation in divorce, custody, and elder and estate law to residents on Long Island in both Nassau and Suffolk County, and all areas of New York City, at reasonable cost.</p><p>Many of the matrimonial matters handled by this firm include complex issues concerning individuals having substantial net worth or who are exceptional wage earners. Our firm represents clients who have issues concerning custody and visitation, prenuptial agreements, separation agreements, equitable distribution of marital property, child suport and maintenance, orders of protection, child neglect, paternity, and all other family law matters. Elder law matters handled by the firm include wills, trusts and estate planning; probate and estate administration; guardianship matters; healthcare proxies; powers of attorney; health care decision making; guardianships; Medicaid income, resources, transfers and spousal impoverishment; and nursing homes and alternatives.</p><hr /><p>A recent article in the "Family Matters" section of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> presents a growing trend towards controlled separations. Instead of seeking a legal separation with the counsel of a lawyer, a couple may plan with a marriage counselor to live apart for a limited period of time, communicating with each other only within predetermined guidelines. To this end, to couple intends to slow down or attempt to stop the building uncertainty and slow emotional descent that typically plagues troubled marriages.</p><p>A recent article in <em>New York Law Journal</em> reports on several recent civil rulings where domestic partners were denied certain rights and benefits typically granted to married couples. Though the cases have not ruled in favor of the partners' rights, they represent attempts to re-examine what rights of married partners can be legally applied to unmarried partners.</p></td><td valign="top" style="border-left: 1px solid #000066"><h1><a href="news.php">News</a></h1><p class="index"><strong>September, 2005</strong> - <a href="http://www.nassaubar.org/newsletter_article.cfm?ArticleID=167" target="blank">"Should No-fault Grounds for Divorce be Enacted in NY"</a></p>       <p class="index"><strong>August 26, 2005</strong> - The Law Offices of Russell I.
