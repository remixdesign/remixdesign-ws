If you face a divorce, it is critical that the legal counsel with whom you invest your trust has the knowledge, experience, reputation and compassion to help you through this ordeal.</p><p>As no two people are alike, neither are any two families, or legal matters involving family situations. Financial implications vary. The degree of psychological and emotional trauma may differ. There may be other legal issues and personal ramifications to be considered.</p><p>Since 1985, the Law Offices of Russell I. Marnell, P.C. has realized this. Concentrating on divorce and family law, our firm has litigated may cases to Court decision, including those involving orders of protection, child abuse and neglect.</p><p>Having passed the CPA examination and holding an MBA in accounting along with  his law degree, Mr. Marnell understands and has lectured on procedures to value  businesses, professional  practices and licenses. His extensive experience  with the Mental Health community has enhanced his working understanding of  the DSM-IVR, brain-washing and Parental Alienation Syndrome. This knowledge is invaluable for interviewing, examining, and cross-examining  witnesses and obtaining favorable settlements.</p><p>With fully computerized operations, our own web site, and a complete New York State law library, we can keep pace with the changes in legal statutes affecting Family Law.</p><p>Above all is our concern for the individual client and our ability to handle every case on a personal basis, in an expeditious matter, and at a reasonable cost. We are available around the clock for emergencies and are also available for weekend and evening appointments.</p><p>Se habla espa&ntilde;ol- Spanish speaking clients are very welcome.</p> <p class="disclaimer">Please read our disclaimer:<br />If there are any problems with this site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@marnelllaw.com?subject=MarnellLaw.com">info@marnelllaw.com</a> We welcome any suggestions for new links and to improve the site.
