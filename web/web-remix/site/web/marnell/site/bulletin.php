The judgment of divorce had granted the parties joint legal custody with the mother being awarded physical custody and the father having mid-week overnight visitation with the children. The mother was living with the children and her new husband in Nassau County. When her husband obtained a job in Albany, she filed an application requesting that mid-week visitation by the father be eliminated. The court appointed a forensic evaluator and law guardian to determine the best interests of the children. The mother made it clear to the forensic evaluator that she would be relocating with or without her children. Based on interviews with the children, who expressed their desire to remain with their father, and the law guardian recommendation that strong consideration be given to awarding physical custody to the father, the court not only denied the mother's request to modify the father's visitation, but transferred physical custody of the children to their father.</p><p><strong>Parents Found Educationally Negligent for Child's Unexcused School Absenses</strong></p><p>Based on a complaint filed by the Nassau County Department of Social Services, a court found that the parents of a 13-year-old girl were educationally negligent in allowing their daughter to be absent in excess of 150 days during one school year without a valid excuse. The girl, who had always been below grade level in reading throughout her school years, was able to pass her classes and be promoted year after year. However, she failed several subjects in 6th and 7th grades and had to attend summer school before being promoted to 8th grade. Beginning with October of 8th grade the girl began her frequent unexplained absences from school.</p><p>The school contacted the girl's parents in an attempt to determine why the girl was not attending school. The mother claimed that her daughter was being mistreated by both teachers and students alike due to her learning disabilities, although she had never before made any type of accusation or complaint against the school. The father was unresponsive to the school's inquiries. In December the girl began seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with an anxiety disorder and he recommended that the parents transfer her to another school. Instead of following through with finding another school, the parents just allowed the absences to continue through the end of the school year, after which the Department of Social Services filed their complaint. Upon facing judicial intervention, the parents began to ensure the daughter's attendance in school the following school year. Nonetheless, the court determined that the year-long absences from school were emotionally harmful to the girl and made an affirmative finding against the parents.</p><h1>News Bulletin - August 2004</h1><p><strong>Common Law Marriage Not Recognized in New York</strong></p><p>A woman claiming to have had a "common law" marriage established in Pennsylvania filed a Summons and Complaint for a divorce in New York. The man asserted that the requirements of a common law marriage were never met during the entirety of their 6-year relationship.  The "wife" stated the couple had lived together for the past six years, that they introduced themselves to others as husband and wife, and that the "husband" gave the "wife" credit cards to use by signing the surname of the "husband."  Common law marriage is recognized in New York only if the statutory requirements of the jurisdiction in which it was entered into are met. The burden to prove a "marriage" was created absent a civil or religious ceremony is very heavy. Some indications that a "marriage" was entered into would be establishing joint bank accounts, credit cards, tax returns, life insurance policies naming the other as beneficiary, etc. A residence that could be deemed a marital home would also be an indication that a "marriage" was understood by both parties to have been created. In this case, the court held that the woman was unable to support her assertion that the couple was "married" and dismissed her complaint.</p><p><strong>Dog Bite Liability</strong></p><p>A court has tried to establish guidelines for when a dog owner can be held responsible for the vicious behavior of his pet. This stems from a case in which a 12-year-old boy was bitten on the face by a dog whose home he was visiting. The owners usually kept the dog behind a gate when guests would visit in order to prevent his excessive barking. However, the dog did not seem to act in an aggressive or threatening manner. This time, the owner suggested that the boy let the dog get acquainted with him by sniffing his hand while the owner restrained the dog. Without any provocation, the dog lunged at the boy and bit him on the face.</p><p>In general, dog's owners can be held responsible for their dog's vicious propensities when it has been established that the owner knew or should have known that the dog poses a threat to people, i.e. growling or baring its teeth. The court held that in this case, the owners were not "on notice" that their dog was a threat in that his only "crime" prior to the attack was to bark excessively at visitors to his home.</p><h1>News Bulletin - April 2004</h1><p><strong>Appellate Court Permits Adoption by Lesbian Couple</strong></p><p>A State Appellate Court has approved the adoption of a 5-year-old Cambodian girl by a lesbian couple in Rochester, New York.  Although no one had opposed the adoption petition submitted by the couple, a family court judge dismissed it on the ground that they did not comply with a domestic relations law that says only an unmarried adult or a husband and his wife may adopt a child. The couple have lived together for 22 years, have registered as domestic partners and participated in a "commitment ceremony" recognized by the Episcopal Church. They had previously adopted another child in 1996. The Appellate Court noted that the domestic relations law "neither expressly prohibits petitioners, as an unmarried couple from adopting the child jointly...nor expressly permits them to do so" and reversed the family court decision in the best interests of the child, as her first adoptive parents returned her to the adoption agency.</p><p><strong>DNA Paternity Testing</strong></p><p>A woman and her 11-month-old son were run down and killed by an allegedly drug-impaired driver.  The father, as administrator of the estate of the child and his mother, has sued the driver for wrongful death. However, the grandmother of the baby has challenged the paternity of the father alleging that he abandoned the child by failing to support him. In order for the father to sue the driver, it must be determined that he is the rightful heir to the child's estate. The parties have agreed to a DNA test to establish paternity and to be bound by the results. Also at issue is the timing of the deaths of the mother and child.  If the mother died first, then the child's share of the estate will be larger.  If the child died first, then the grandmother's share of the estate will be larger.</p><h1>News Bulletin - February 2004</h1><p><strong>Out-of-State Divorce Issue</strong></p><p>A woman who obtained a no-fault divorce in Vermont was barred from receiving equitable distribution of New York marital property valued at more than $186,000.00. The couple was married in 1959 and had eight children. The wife and children moved out in 1982 when the wife commenced a divorce action alleging cruel and inhuman treatment. The case was discontinued in 1986 for failure of proof. The wife moved to Vermont in 1993 and brought a divorce action there under the state's no-fault statute. The husband appeared in court in the Vermont action as the wife's attorney erroneously told the court that the only issue was the divorce because all of the couple's assets were in New York. The wife was granted the divorce. However, in 1995, the wife commenced an equitable distribution action in New York and was awarded $186,670.00. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision stating that even though the wife's attorney in the divorce action wrongly assumed Vermont didn't have jurisdiction to distribute the marital property, the Vermont court could and should have done so.</p><p><strong>Psychologist Notes Are Not Discoverable in a Custody Dispute</strong></p><p>In a highly contested divorce/custody matter, a Brooklyn judge ruled that a court-appointed psychologist did not have to submit his notes of interviews with a couple's children.</p><p>The wife contends that the forensic evaluator, who recommended joint custody, based his report on insufficient time spent with the couple's two children. However, the forensic report included a 58-page appendix which included direct quotes and statements from the interviews with the parties and their children.</p><p>The court based is denial of the application on the fact that forensic reports and law guardian recommendations do not determine custody. Rather, the Court uses the reports and recommendations as a factor in its determination of custody. A report is subject to cross examination by both parties and the Court makes the final decision based on all the evidence.</p><p class="disclaimer">Please read our disclaimer:<br />If there are any problems with this site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@marnelllaw.com?subject=MarnellLaw.com">info@marnelllaw.com</a> We welcome any suggestions for new links and to improve the site.
