<P>&nbsp;TITONE, J.: 
<P>&nbsp;In each of these appeals, a di<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rced 
spouse who was pre<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously granted custody of the 
couple's minor offspring seeks permission to mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
away from the area in which the noncustodial spouse resides. Both noncustodial 
spouses oppose the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, contending that it would 
significantly reduce the access to the children that they now enjoy. Their 
respecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> appeals from the Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion order and the Family Court judgment authorizing 
the requested mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s raise significant questions 
regarding the scope and nature of the inquiry that should be made in cases where 
a custodial parent proposes to relocate and seeks judicial appro<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>l of the relocation plan. 
<P>&nbsp;I. 
<P>&nbsp;<SPAN class=highlight><SPAN class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN><SPAN class=highlight><SPAN 
class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN></SPAN> <BR>The parties in this case were married 
in 1981 and ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> two children, one born in 1985 and 
the other in 1988. They were di<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rced in 1992 
pursuant to a judgment that incorporated their pre<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously executed separation agreement. Under that 
agreement, petitioner-mother, who had pre<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously 
been the children's primary caregi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, was to 
ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> sole custody of the children and 
respondent-father was granted <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation on 
holidays and "at least three * * * days of each week." Additionally, the parties 
were barred from relocating outside of Onondaga County, where both resided, 
without prior judicial appro<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>l. 
<P>&nbsp;On June 4, 1993, petitioner brought this proceeding seeking changes in 
the <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation arrangements and permission to 
relocate with the children to the Schenectady area. Respondent opposed the 
requested relief and filed a cross-petition for a change of custody. At the 
ensuing hearing, petitioner testified that she wanted to mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> because of her plans to marry an architect who had an 
established firm in Schenectady. According to petitioner, she and her fianc had 
already purchased a home in the Schenectady area for themsel<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s and the <SPAN class=highlight><SPAN 
class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN></SPAN> children and were now expecting a child of 
their own. Petitioner stated that she was willing to cooperate in a liberal 
<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation schedule that would afford respondent 
frequent and extended contact and that she was prepared to dri<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the children to and from their father's Syracuse home, 
which is about two and a half hours away from Schenectady. Nonetheless, as all 
parties recognized, the distance between the two homes made mid-week <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits during the school term impossible. 
<P>&nbsp;Respondent took the position that petitioner's "need" to mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> was really the product of her own life- style choice 
and that, consequently, he should not be the parent who is "punished" with the 
loss of proximity and weekday contact. Instead, respondent proposed that he be 
awarded custody of the children if petitioner chose to relocate. To support this 
proposal, respondent adduced e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence to show that 
he had maintained frequent and consistent contact with his children at least 
until June of 1993, when the instant proceeding was commenced. He had coached 
the children's football and baseball teams, participated in their religion 
classes and had become in<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>l<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d with his older son's academic education during the 
1992-1993 school year. Howe<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, there was also 
e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence that respondent harbored a continuing 
bitterness toward petitioner which he had <SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rbalized and demonstrated to the children in a number 
of inappropriate ways. Respondent admitted being bitter enough to ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> called petitioner "a tramp" and "a low-life" in the 
children's presence and, in fact, stated that he saw nothing wrong with this 
conduct, although he acknowledged that it had a negati<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> effect on the children. Respondent's mother confirmed 
that he had spoken negati<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>ly about petitioner in 
the children's presence and that this beha<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>or had 
not been helpful to the children. 
<P>&nbsp;Following the hearing, the presiding Judicial Hearing Officer denied 
petitioner's request for permission to relocate. Applying what he characterized 
as "a more restricti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew of relocation," the JHO opined that whene<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r a proposed mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> "unduly 
disrupts or substantially impairs the [noncustodial parent's] access rights to 
[the] children," the custodial spouse seeking judicial consent must bear the 
burden of demonstrating "exceptional circumstances" such as a "concrete economic 
necessity." Applying this principle to the e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence 
before it, the JHO found that petitioner's desire to obtain a "fresh start" with 
a new family was insufficient to justify a mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
that would "significantly impact upon" the close and consistent relationship 
with his chidren that respondent had pre<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously 
enjoyed. 
<P>&nbsp;On petitioner's appeal, howe<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, the 
Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion re<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rsed, holding that petitioner had made the necessary 
showing that the requested relocation would not depri<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> respondent of "regular and meaningful access to his 
children." Further, the court noted, petitioner's proposed <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation schedule afforded respondent the opportunity 
for frequent and extended contact with his children. Finally, the court found 
that the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would be in the best interests of the 
children. Accordingly, the court ruled that petitioner should be permitted to 
mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> to Schenectady and remitted the matter to 
Family Court for the establishment of an appropriate <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation schedule. The final Family Court judgment from 
which respondent appeals awards respondent substantial weekend, summer and <SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>cation <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation in 
accordance with the Law Guardian's recommended schedule.<A

<P>&nbsp;Browner <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Kenward <BR>The parties to this 
proceeding were married in August of 1983 and had a son three years later. After 
marital discord led the parties to separate, they executed a Stipulation of 
Settlement and Agreement in January of 1992 which ga<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> petitioner-mother physical custody of the couple's 
child and ga<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> respondent- father liberal <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation, including midweek o<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rnight <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits and 
alternating weekends. Under the Stipulation, respondent was to remain in the 
marital residence, which was located in White Plains, New York, and petitioner 
and the parties' son were to li<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> with petitioner's 
parents in nearby Purchase. Petitioner was required to seek prior appro<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>l of the court if she intended to mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> more than 35 miles from respondent's residence. The 
Stipulation was incorporated but not merged in the parties' di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rce judgment, which was entered in June of 1992. 
<P>&nbsp;In October of 1992, petitioner brought the present proceeding for 
permission to relocate with the couple's child to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 
some 130 miles from respondent's Westchester County home. Petitioner requested 
this relief because her parents were mo<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng to 
Pittsfield and she wished to go with them. Respondent opposed the application, 
contending that he was a committed and in<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>l<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d noncustodial parent and that the proposed mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would depri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> him of 
meaningful contact with his son. 
<P>&nbsp;A hearing was conducted o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r a period of 
se<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>ral months. The hearing e<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence disclosed that petitioner's parents had been 
considering mo<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng for some time and had made the 
final decision to do so in September of 1992, coinciding fairly closely with the 
loss of petitioner's job. Petitioner testified that she had tried to find work 
in New York but was unable to do so. She further testified that her prospects of 
finding affordable housing in the Purchase area were bleak. She ultimately 
located a marketing job in Pittsfield that would gi<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> her enough income to rent a home of her own in that 
area. Petitioner had also in<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>stigated the 
facilities for children in Pittsfield and had found a suitable school and 
synagogue for her son. 
<P>&nbsp;An additional moti<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>ting factor for 
petitioner was the emotional support and child care that she recei<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d from her parents and that she expected to recei<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> from her extended family in Pittsfield. According to 
the e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence, petitioner was somewhat dependent on 
her parents for financial and moral support, and petitioner's son had become 
especially close to his grandparents after his own parents had separated. 
Further, the boy had a long-standing close relationship with his Pittsfield 
cousins. 
<P>&nbsp;Respondent argued that permission for the mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> should be denied because it would significantly 
diminish the quantity and quality of his <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits 
with his child. Respondent noted that the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
would eliminate the mid-week <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits that he had 
pre<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously enjoyed as well as his opportunity to 
participate in the child's daily school, sports and religious acti<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ties. Accordingly, respondent argued, petitioner's 
proposed relocation to Pittsfield would depri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> him 
of meaningful access to his child. 
<P>&nbsp;The Family Court found petitioner's argument that she was unable to 
secure employment and new housing within the Westchester area to be less than 
con<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ncing. The court further found that respondent 
had been "<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>gilant" in <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>siting his son and was "sincerely interested in guiding 
and nurturing [the] child." Nonetheless, the court ruled in petitioner's fa<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>r and authorized the proposed mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, granting respondent liberal <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation rights. In so ruling, the court noted that the 
mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would not depri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
respondent of meaningful contact with his son and that, in light of the 
psychological e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence that had been adduced, the 
mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would be in the child's best interests. With 
respect to the best-interests question, the court stated that the parents' 
separation from each other would reduce the bickering that was causing the child 
difficulty and would enable the child to ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the 
healthy peer relationships that he needed. Additionally, the emotional ad<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>ntages that petitioner would realize from proximity to 
her parents would ultimately enhance the child's emotional well-being. On 
respondent's appeal, the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion 
affirmed, stating only that "the relocation did not depri<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> [respondent] of regular and meaningful access to the 
child" and, thus, petitioner was "not required to show exceptional circumstances 
to justify relocation." This Court subsequently granted respondent lea<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> to appeal. 
<P>&nbsp;II. 
<P>&nbsp;Relocation cases such as the two before us present some of the 
knottiest and most disturbing problems that our courts are called upon to 
resol<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>. In these cases, the interests of a 
custodial parent who wishes to mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> away are pitted 
against those of a noncustodial parent who has a powerful desire to maintain 
frequent and regular contact with the child. Moreo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, the court must weigh the paramount interests of the 
child, which may or may not be in irreconcilable conflict with those of one or 
both of the parents. 
<P>&nbsp;Because the resolution of relocation disputes is ordinarily a matter 
entrusted to the fact-finding and discretionary powers of the lower courts, our 
Court has not had frequent occasion to address the question. We discussed the 
issue in general terms in <I>Weiss <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Weiss</I> (52 
NY2d 170, 174-175), in which we recognized the importance of continued regular 
and frequent <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation between the child and the 
noncustodial parent and stated that "absent exceptional circumstances * * * , 
appropriate pro<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion for <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation or other access by the noncustodial parent 
follows almost as a matter of course" (citing <I>Strahl <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Strahl</I>, 66 AD2d 571, affd 49 NY2d 1036). We re<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sited the area a year later in <I>Daghir <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Daghir</I> (56 NY2d 938), but the majority memorandum 
in that case merely commented on the trial court's failure to separately 
consider the child's best interests and did not otherwise elucidate the proper 
standard to be used in assessing requests by custodial parents for permission to 
relocate (see also, <I>Priebe <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Priebe</I>, 55 NY2d 
997 [upholding Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion's discretionary 
determination]). 
<P>&nbsp;Since our decisions in <I>Weiss</I> and <I>Daghir</I>, the lower courts 
ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> e<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>l<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d a series of formulae and presumptions to aid them in 
making their decisions in these difficult relocation cases. The most commonly 
used formula in<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>l<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s 
a three-step analysis that looks first to whether the proposed relocation would 
depri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the noncustodial parent of "regular and 
meaningful access to the child" (e.g., <I>La<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>ne 
<SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>La<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>ne</I>, 201 AD2d 
623; <I>Lake <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Lake</I>, 192 AD2d 751; <I>Radford 
<SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Propper</I>, 190 AD2d 93; <I>Schaefer <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Brennan</I>, 170 AD2d 879; <I>Cassidy <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Kapur</I>, 164 AD2d 513; <I>Schouten <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Schouten</I>, 155 AD2d 461; <I>Blundell <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Blundel</I>, 150 AD2d 321; <I>Murphy <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Murphy</I>, 145 AD2d 857; <I>Zaleski <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Zaleski</I>, 128 AD2d 865; <I>Klein <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Klein</I>, 93 AD2d 807). Where a disruption of "regular 
and meaningful access" is not shown, the inquiry is truncated, and the courts 
generally will not go on to assess the merits and strength of the custodial 
parents' moti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> for mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng (see, e.g., <I>Bennett <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Bennett</I>, 208 AD2d 1042; <I>Partridge <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Meyerson</I>, 162 AD2d 507; <I>Lake <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Lake</I>, supra). On the other hand, where such a disruption is 
established, a presumption that the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> is not in 
the child's best interest is in<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>ked and the 
custodial parent seeking to relocate must demonstrate "exceptional 
circumstances" to justify the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> (e.g., 
<I>La<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>lle <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Freeman</I>, 181 AD2d 977; <I>Rybicki <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Rybicki</I>, 176 AD2d 867; <I>Hathaway <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Hathaway</I>, 175 AD2d 336). Once that hurdle is o<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rcome, the court will go on to consider the child's 
best interests. 
<P>&nbsp;The premise underlying this formula is that children can deri<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> an abundance of benefits from "the mature guiding hand 
and lo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> of a second parent" (<I>Weiss <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Weiss</I>, supra, at 175; accord, <I>Radford <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Propper</I>, supra, at 99) and that, consequently, 
geographic changes that significantly impair the quantity and quality of 
parent-child contacts are to be "disfa<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>red" (see, 
<I>Farmer <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Der<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>y</I>, 174 AD2d 857, 858; <I>Matter of Pasco <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Nolen</I>, 154 AD2d 774, 776; <I>Matter of Towne <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Towne</I>, 154 AD2d 766, 767). While this premise has 
much merit as a tenet of human dynamics, the legal formula that it has spawned 
is problematic and, in many respects, unsatisfactory (see, Miller, Hon. S., 
Whate<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r Happened to the "Best Interests" Analysis 
in New York Relocation Cases?, 15 Pace L Re<SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>339). 
<P>&nbsp;One problem with the three-tiered analysis is that it is difficult to 
apply. The lower courts ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> not settled on a 
uniform method of defining "meaningful access" (compare, <I>Bennett <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Bennett</I>, supra, at 1043 [ability to maintain "close 
and meaningful relationship with * * * children], with <I>Radford <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Propper</I>, supra, at 99 ["frequent and regular 
access"]), and e<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n the distance of the mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> has not been a reliable indicator of whether the 
"meaningful access" test has been satisfied (compare, <I>Rybicki <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Rybicki</I>, supra [disappro<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng 84-mile mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>] with 
<I>Schouten <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Schouten</I>, 155 AD2d 461 
[appro<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng 258-mile mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>]; <I>Murphy <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Murphy</I>, 
145 AD2d 857 [appro<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng 340-mile mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>]). 
<P>&nbsp;On a more fundamental le<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>l, the 
three-tiered test is unsatisfactory because it erects artificial barriers to the 
courts' consideration of all of the rele<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt 
factors. Most mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s outside of the noncustodial 
parent's locale ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> some disrupti<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> effect on that parent's relationship with the child. 
Yet, if the disruption does not rise to the le<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>l 
of a depri<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>tion of "meaningful access," the 
three-tiered analysis would permit it without any further inquiry into such 
salient considerations as the custodial parent's moti<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s, the reasons for the proposed mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> and the positi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> or 
negati<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> impact of the change on the child. 
Similarly, where the noncustodial parent has managed to o<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rcome the threshold "meaningful access" hurdle, the 
three-tiered approach requires courts to refuse consent if there are no 
"exceptional circumstances" to justify the change, again without necessarily 
considering whether the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would ser<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the child's best interests or whether the benefits to 
the children would outweigh the diminution in access by the noncustodial parent. 
The distorting effect of such a mechanical approach may be amplified where the 
courts require a showing of economic necessity or health- related compulsion to 
establish the requisite "exceptional circumstances" (see, e.g., <I>La<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>lle <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Freeman</I>, supra; 
<I>Leslie <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Leslie</I>, 180 AD2d 620; <I>Goodwin 
<SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Goodwin</I>, 173 AD2d 769; <I>Coniglio <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Coniglio</I>, 170 AD2d 477) or where the demands of a 
new marriage are summarily rejected as a sufficient basis for satisfying this 
test (e.g., <I>Rybicki <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Rybicki</I>, supra; 
<I>Richardson <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Howard</I>, 135 AD2d 1140). 
<P>&nbsp;In reality, cases in which a custodial parent's desire to relocate 
conflicts with the desire of a noncustodial parent to maximize <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation opportunity are simply too complex to be 
satisfactorily handled within any mechanical, tiered analysis that pre<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>nts or interferes with a simultaneous weighing and 
comparati<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> analysis of all of the rele<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt facts and circumstances. Although we ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> recognized and continue to appreciate both the need of 
the child and the right of the noncustodial parent to ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> regular and meaningful contact (see generally, 
<I>Weiss <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Weiss</I>, supra), we also belie<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> that no single factor should be treated as 
dispositi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> or gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n 
such disproportionate weight as to predetermine the outcome. There are 
undoubtedly circumstances in which the loss of mid-week or e<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>ry-weekend <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits 
necessitated by a distant mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> may be de<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>stating to the relationship between the noncustodial 
parent and the child. Howe<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, there are 
undoubtedly also many cases where less frequent but more extended <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r summers and 
school <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>cations would be equally conduci<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, or perhaps e<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n more 
conduci<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, to the maintenance of a close 
parent-child relationship, since such extended <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the parties the 
opportunity to interact in a normalized domestic setting. In any e<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>nt, gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n the <SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>riety of possible permutations, it is 
counterproducti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> to rely on presumptions whose 
only real <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>lue is to simplify what are necessarily 
extremely complicated inquiries. 
<P>&nbsp;Accordingly, rather than endorsing the three- step meaningful 
access-exceptional circumstance analysis that some of the lower courts ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> used in the past, we hold that each relocation request 
must be considered on its own merits with due consideration of all the rele<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt facts and circumstances and with predominant 
emphasis being placed on what outcome is most likely to ser<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the bests interests of the child. While the 
respecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> rights of the custodial and noncustodial 
parents are unquestionably significant factors that must be considered (see, 
<I>Strahl <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Strahl</I>, 66 AD2d 571, affd 49 NY2d 
1036, supra), it is the rights and needs of the children that must be accorded 
the greatest weight, since they are innocent <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ctims of their parents' decision to di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rce and are the least equipped to handle the stresses 
of the changing family situation. 
<P>&nbsp;Of course, the impact of the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> on the 
relationship between the child and the noncustodial parent will remain a central 
concern. Indeed, e<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n where the mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would lea<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the 
noncustodial parent with what may be considered "meaningful access," there is 
still a need to weigh the effect of the quantitati<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> and qualitati<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> losses 
that naturally will result against such other rele<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt factors as the custodial parent's reasons for 
wanting to relocate and the benefits that the child may enjoy or the harm that 
may ensue if the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> is or is not permitted. 
Similarly, although economic necessity or a specific health- related concern may 
present a particularly persuasi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> ground for 
permitting the proposed mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, other justifications, 
including the demands of a second marriage and the custodial parent's 
opportunity to impro<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> his or her economic 
situation, may also be <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>lid moti<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s that should not be summarily rejected, at least where 
the o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rall impact on the child would be 
beneficial. While some courts ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> suggested that 
the custodial spouse's remarriage or wish for a "fresh start" can ne<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r suffice to justify a distant mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> (see, e.g., <I>Elkus <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Elkus</I>, 182 AD2d 445, 48; <I>Stec <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Le<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ndofske</I>, 153 AD2d 310), such a rule 
o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rlooks the <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>lue 
for the children that strengthening and stabilizing the new, post-di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rce family unit can ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
in a particular case. 
<P>&nbsp;In addition to the custodial parent's stated reasons for wanting to 
mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> and the noncustodial parent's loss of access, 
another factor that may well become important in a particular case is the 
noncustodial parent's interest in securing custody, as well as the feasibility 
and desirability of a change in custody. Ob<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously, 
where a child's ties to the noncustodial parent and to the community are so 
strong as to make a long-distance mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> undesirable, 
the a<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>ilability of a transfer of custody as 
realistic alternati<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> to forcing the custodial 
parent to remain may ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> a significant impact on 
the outcome. By the same token, where the custodial parent's reasons for mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng are deemed <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>lid and 
sound, the court in a proper case might consider the possibility and feasibility 
of a parallel mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> by an in<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>l<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d and committed 
noncustodial parent as an alternati<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> to 
restricting a custodial parent's mobility. 
<P>&nbsp;Other considerations that may ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> a 
bearing in particular cases are the good faith of the parents in requesting or 
opposing the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, the child's respecti<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> attachments to the custodial and noncustodial parent, 
the possibility of de<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sing a <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation schedule that will enable the noncustodial 
parent to maintain a meaningful parent-child relationship, the quality of the 
lifestyle that the child would ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> if the proposed 
mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> were permitted or denied, the negati<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> impact, if any, from continued or exacerbated 
hostility between the custodial and noncustodial parents, and the effect that 
the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> may ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> on 
any extended-family relationships. Of course, any other facts or circumstances 
that ha<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> a bearing on the parties' situation 
should be weighed with a <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew toward minimizing the 
parents' discomfort and maximizing the child's prospects of a stable, 
comfortable and happy life. 
<P>&nbsp;Like Humpty Dumpty, a family, once broken by di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rce, cannot be put back together in precisely the same 
way. The relationship between the parents and the children is necessarily 
different after a di<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rce and, accordingly, it may 
be unrealistic in some cases to try to preser<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the 
noncustodial parent's accustomed close in<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>l<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>ment in the children's e<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>ryday life at the expense of the custodial parent's 
efforts to start a new life or to form a new family unit. In some cases, the 
child's interests might be better ser<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d by 
fashioning <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation plans that maximize the 
noncustodial parent's opportunity to maintain a positi<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> nurturing relationship while enabling the custodial 
parent, who has the primary child-rearing responsibility, to go forward with his 
or her life. In any e<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>nt, it ser<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s neither the interests of the children nor the ends of 
justice to <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew relocation cases through the prisms 
of presumptions and threshold tests that artificially skew the analysis in 
fa<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>r of one outcome or another. 
<P>&nbsp;Rather, we hold that, in all cases, the courts should be free to 
consider and gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> appropriate weight to all of the 
factors that may be rele<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt to the determination. 
These factors include, but are certainly not limited to each parent's reasons 
for seeking or opposing the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, the quality of 
the relationships between the child and the custodial and noncustodial parents, 
the impact of the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> on the quantity and quality 
of the child's future contact with the noncustodial parent, the degree to which 
the custodial parent's and child's life may be enhanced economically, 
emotionally and educationally by the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, and the 
feasibility of preser<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng the relationship between 
the noncustodial parent and child through suitable <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation arrangements. In the end, it is for the court 
to determine, based on all of the proof, whether it has been established by a 
preponderance of the e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence that a proposed 
relocation would ser<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the child's best 
interests.<A href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I96_0048.htm#n2a" 
name=n2></A><I><A href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I96_0048.htm#n2a" 
name=n2>[n 2]</A></I> III. 
<P>&nbsp;Turning finally to the cases before us, we conclude that the orders of 
the courts below, which appro<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d each of the 
petitioners' requests to mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>, should be upheld. In 
<I><SPAN class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN></I>, petitioner sought permission to 
relocate from Onondaga County to the Schenectady area so that she could settle 
into a new home with her fianc and raise her sons within a new family unit. The 
Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion found that the mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> was in the children's best interest and that the <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation schedule that petitioner proposed would afford 
respondent frequent and extended <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation<A 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I96_0048.htm#n3a" name=n3></A><I><A 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I96_0048.htm#n3a" name=n3>[n 3]</A></I>. 
We find no reason deri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d from the record to upset 
the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion's determinations on these 
points (see, <I>Daghir <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Daghir</I>, supra, at 
940). It is true that the court considered whether the relocation would 
depri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> respondent of "meaningful access" to his 
children. Howe<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, it is apparent from the 
remainder of its writing that the court did not treat that factor as a threshold 
test barring further inquiry into the salient "best interests" question. 
<P>&nbsp;We note that respondent has offered no persuasia<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> legal reason for disturbing the Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion's finding that the proposed relocation would be in 
the children's best interest. Indeed, in this appeal, respondent's arguments are 
directed almost entirely to petitioner's purported "unclean hands" in de<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>loping a relationship with a person she met before the 
marriage was dissol<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d and in choosing to marry 
that indi<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dual after her di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rce from respondent. As is e<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dent from our earlier discussion, relocation 
determinations are not to be made as a means of castigating one party for what 
the other deems personal misconduct, nor are the courts to be used in this 
context as arbiters of the parties' respecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
"guilt" or "innocence." Children are not chattel, and custody and <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation decisions should be made with a <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew toward what best ser<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s 
their interests, not what would reward or penalize a purportedly "innocent" or 
"blameworthy" parent. 
<P>&nbsp;Our analysis in <I>Browner <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Kenward</I> 
is somewhat different. The Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion in 
<I>Browner</I> found that the proposed mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> did not 
depri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the noncustodial parent of regular and 
meaningful access to his child and that it was therefore not necessary to weigh 
the <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>lidity and strength of petitioner's reasons 
for mo<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng against the significant change in the 
parent- child relationship that the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> would 
entail. The court's methodology was thus at <SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>riance with the open- ended balancing analysis that the 
law requires. Howe<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, respondent's only argument 
in this Court is that the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion 
misapplied the three-tiered <I>Radford <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Propper</I> (supra) test to the particular facts of his case. 
Specifically, respondent argues that the 130-mile mo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> from Westchester County to Pittsfield will eliminate 
his mid-week <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation opportunity, reduce his 
ability to participate in his son's religious worship and diminish the quality 
of the weekend <SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sits he has with his son. While 
these losses are undoubtedly real and are certainly far from tri<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>al, it cannot be said that they operated to depri<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> respondent of a meaningful opportunity to maintain a 
close relationship with his son. Hence, respondent was not entitled to an order 
re<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rsing the outcome below and denying petitioner 
the permission to relocate that she sought. We note that the Family Court found 
that the proposed relocation in <I>Browner</I> was in the child's best interests 
and the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion did not disturb that 
finding. 
<P>&nbsp;Accordingly, in <I><SPAN class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN> v <SPAN 
class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN></I>, the judgment of the Family Court and the 
prior nonfinal order of the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion 
brought up for re<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew should be affirmed, with 
costs. In <I>Browner <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Kenward</I>, the order of 
the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion should be affirmed, with 
costs. 
<P>&nbsp;F O O T N O T E S 
<P>&nbsp;<A name=n1a></A>1. This Court dismissed respondent's earlier motion for 
lea<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> to appeal from the prior Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion order on the ground that that order did not 
finally determine the proceeding within the meaning of the Constitution (<A 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ny/ctap/085_0968.htm">85 NY2d 968</A>).<A

<P>&nbsp;<A name=n2a></A>2. The separation agreements in both <I><SPAN 
class=highlight>Tropea</SPAN></I> and <I>Browner</I> require only that the 
custodial parent apply for judicial appro<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>l before 
mo<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng out of a specified area without making any 
mention of criteria or standards. A geographical relocation restriction agreed 
to by the parties and included in their separation agreement might be an 
additional factor rele<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt to a court's best 
interests determination.<A

<P>&nbsp;<A name=n3a></A>3. Significantly, the Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion's ruling in this regard did not represent a 
re<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rsal of any contrary first-le<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>l factual finding by the nisi prius court. The Family 
Court JHO did not reach the best- interest question, since, in his <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew, petitioner's failure to show "exceptional 
circumstances" to justify the mo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> ob<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ated the need for further inquiry.<A
