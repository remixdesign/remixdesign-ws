No. 102 [1995 NY Int. 113]<BR>Decided May 9, 1995
<HR>
 This opinion is uncorrected and subject to re<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion before publication in the New York Reports.
<P>Perry S. Reich, for Appellant.<BR>Submitted by Michael Dikman, for 
Respondent.
<P>KAYE, CHIEF JUDGE:
<P>The focus of this appeal is the Child Support Standards Act (Family Court Act 
§ 413; Domestic Relations Law § 240), which includes a numeric formula for 
calculating the award of child support, prescribing criteria as to combined 
parental income under $80,000 and criteria as to income abo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> that amount. We are asked to re<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew an award determined by application of the statutory 
formula to combined parental income exceeding $80,000. We conclude that the 
award was proper and affirm the Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion 
order so holding.
<P>The parties here were di<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>rced in 1986, with two 
children, one of whom is now emancipated. Plaintiff mother was awarded custody 
of the children and defendant father was ordered to pay $125 per week in child 
support. In 1989 plaintiff petitioned for an upward modification of the support 
award for the nonemancipated child pursuant to the newly enacted child support 
statute, and defendant cross-petitioned for a downward modification.
<P>After taking e<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>dence in a two-day hearing 
relating to the family's income and expenses, the Hearing Examiner found a 
substantial increase in the parties' financial circumstances warranting 
increased child support. On combined parental income of $99,944 (64.4% of it 
attributable to the father), the Hearing Examiner ordered defendant to pay $218 
per week. That amount was determined by multiplying the parents' total income by 
the statutory percentage (17%) and then allocating 64.4% of that amount to the 
father. The Hearing Examiner further ordered defendant to pay his pro rata share 
of the child's pri<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>te school costs <A 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I95_0113.htm#n1a" name=n1><I>[n 
1]</I></A> and unreimbursed medical expenses.
<P>Before Family Court, the father contended that the Hearing Examiner erred in 
applying the statutory percentage to income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r 
$80,000 without setting forth reasons for that particular award. Family Court 
concluded that the statute permitted that and, absent good cause, refused to 
interfere with the Hearing Examiner's exercise of discretion to apply the 
percentage. The Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion agreed with the 
father that Family Court was required to state reasons for the award of child 
support on combined parental income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r $80,000 
but found that requirement satisfied by the Hearing Examiner's in-depth 
consideration of the parties' circumstances. The Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion additionally affirmed the award of unreimbursed 
medical expenses. We now affirm.
<P>The Child Support Standards Act, effecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> 
September 15, 1989, replaced a needs-based discretionary system with a precisely 
articulated, three-step method for determining child support. Enactment of this 
statute after long efforts signalled a new era in calculating child support 
awards (see generally, Reichler and Lefcourt, The New Child Support Standards 
Act, NY State Bar Journal 36 [February 1990]; Note, The Child Support Standards 
Act and the New York Judiciary: Fortifying the 17 Percent Solution, 56 Brooklyn 
L Re<SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>1299).
<P>The Act had among its objecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s the assurance 
that both parents would contribute to the support of the children, and that the 
children would not "unfairly bear the economic burden of parental separation" 
(Go<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rnor's Program Bill Memorandum, Bill Jacket, L 
1989, ch 567, at 1). Emphasis was to shift "from a balancing of the expressed 
needs of the child and the income a<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>ilable to the 
parents after expenses to the total income a<SPAN 
class=highlight>va</SPAN>ilable to the parents and the standard of li<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng that should be shared with the child" (Reichler and 
Lefcourt, NY State Bar Journal, supra, at 44; see also, Memorandum of the 
Executi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> Chamber, Bill Jacket, Assembly Bill No. 
2027-A, July 17, 1989 ["children will share in the economic status of both their 
parents"]).
<P>Further, the Legislature percei<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d that the 
existing system produced inconsistent, unpredictable and often seemingly 
arbitrary results, which undermined the parties' confidence in the fairness of 
the process (see, 1989 NY Legis Ann, at 248, citing NY Commn on Child Support 
Report at 69). Consequently, the new statute sought to create greater 
uniformity, predictability and equity in fixing child support awards, while at 
the same time maintaining the degree of judicial discretion necessary to address 
unique circumstances (Letter of Assembly Sponsor Helene E. Weinstein to Go<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rnor Mario Cuomo, June 30, 1989; Go<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rnor's Program Bill Memorandum, Bill Jacket, L 1989, ch 
567, at 5).
<P>As the statute directs, step one of the three-step method is the court's 
calculation of "combined parental income" in accordance with Family Court Act § 
413(1)(b)(4)-(5) (see Domestic Relations Law § 240 for analogous pro<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sions). Second, the court multiplies that figure, up to 
$80,000, by a specified percentage <A 
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I95_0113.htm#n2a" name=n2><I>[n 
2]</I></A> based upon the number of children in the household--17% for one 
child--and then allocates that amount between the parents according to their 
share of the total income (Family Court Act § 413[1][b][3] and [c]).
<P>Third, where combined parental income exceeds $80,000--the situation at issue 
in this case--the statute pro<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>des that "the court 
shall determine the amount of child support for the amount of the combined 
parental income in excess of such dollar amount through consideration of the 
factors set forth in paragraph (f) of this subdi<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion and/or the child support percentage" (Family Court 
Act § 413[1][c][3]). The "paragraph (f)" factors include the financial resources 
of the parents and child, the health of the child and any special needs, the 
standard of li<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng the child would ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> had if the marriage had not ended, tax consequences, 
non-monetary contributions of the parents toward the child, the educational 
needs of the parents, the disparity in the parents' incomes, the needs of other 
nonparty children recei<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ng support from one of the 
parents, extraordinary expenses incurred in exercising <SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sitation and any other factors the court determines are 
rele<SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>nt (Family Court Act § 413[1][f]).
<P>Whene<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r the basic child support obligation 
deri<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d by application of the formula would be 
"unjust or inappropriate," the court must consider the "paragraph (f)" factors. 
That is so whether parental income is abo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> or 
below $80,000 (Family Court Act §§ 413[1][b][1], 413[1][c][2], 413[1][c][3]). If 
the formula is rejected, the statute directs that the court "set forth, in a 
written order, the factors it considered"--an unbending requirement that cannot 
be wai<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d by either party or counsel (Family Court 
Act § 413[1][g]).
<P>The question now before us is whether the court must articulate a reason for 
its award of child support on parental income exceeding $80,000 when it chooses 
simply to apply the statutory percentage. Defendant urges not only that there 
must be a stated reason but also that the stated reason must relate to the needs 
of the child, much as under prior law.
<P>That question has generated uncertainty. Some courts ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> calculated child support awards simply by applying the 
statutory percentages to parental income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r 
$80,000 (see, e.g., <I>DeBernardo <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>DeBernardo</I>, 
180 AD2d 500, 502-503; <I>Rosen <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Rosen</I>, NYLJ, 
October 9, 1990, p. 31, col 5; <I>Brown <SPAN class=highlight>v 
</SPAN>Brown</I>, NYLJ, July 16, 1990, p. 230, col 2; <I>Steel <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Steel</I>, 152 Misc 2d 880, 884). Others ha<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> rejected a "blind application" of the child support 
percentage to income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r $80,000, requiring 
express findings as to the child's actual needs (<I>Harmon <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Harmon</I>, 173 AD2d 98, 111 ["a child is not a partner 
in the marital relationship, entitled to a 'piece of the action'"]; see also, 
<I>Chasin <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Chasin</I>, 182 AD2d 862, 863; 
<I>Colley <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Colley</I>, 200 AD2d 839, 841; 
<I>Panossian <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Panossian</I>, 201 AD2d 983, 983; 
<I>Slankard <SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Chahinian</I>, 204 AD2d 529, 531 [all 
re<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rsing trial court as to child support]). The 
caselaw has e<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n been read to limit the application 
of the percentages to income below $80,000 (see, Florescue, Relocation of 
Custodial Parent, NYLJ, June 14, 1993, p 4, col 6).
<P>Ob<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ously, determining what the Child Support 
Standards Act requires begins with the statute itself.
<P>Where combined parental income is less than $80,000 the statute plainly 
directs that the court apply the formula percentages (Family Court Act § 
413[1][c][2])--thus implementing the objecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s of 
uniformity and predictability. Only where that amount would be "unjust or 
inappropriate" does the Act require the court to set forth reasons.
<P>As to combined parental income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r $80,000, the 
statute explicitly affords an option: the court may apply the factors set forth 
in section 413(1)(f) "and/or the child support percentage" (Family Court Act § 
413[1][c][3]; see also, 1 Tippins, New York Matrimonial Law and Practice § 
5A:20; Reichler and Lefcourt, NY State Bar Journal, supra, at 40). Pertinent as 
well to income abo<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> $80,000 is the pro<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion that the court may disregard the formula if 
"unjust and inappropriate" but in that e<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>nt, must 
gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> its reasons in a formal written order, which 
cannot be wai<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>d by either party (Family Court Act 
§ 413[1][g]).
<P>The parties' arguments for and against requiring an elaboration of reasons 
where the statutory percentage is applied to income exceeding $80,000 center on 
the term "and/or"--a term that has long irked grammarians (see, e.g., Fowler, A 
Dictionary of Modern English Usage 29 [2d ed]). In that legislati<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> purpose, not grammatical perfection, guides our 
determination, we must seek to gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> meaning to the 
term "and/or," in the context of the statute's o<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>rall objecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>. 
Defendant's insistence on an elaboration of needs-based reasons reads the word 
"or" out of the section and rolls back the calendar to pre-1989 law. In our 
<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew, "and/or" should be read to afford courts the 
discretion to apply the "paragraph (f)" factors, or to apply the statutory 
percentages, or to apply both in fixing the basic child support obligation on 
parental income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r $80,000. That interpretation 
is consistent with the language of the section and with the objecti<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>s of the Child Support Standards Act.
<P>That conclusion does not, howe<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r, end our 
analysis. Gi<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>n that the statute explicitly <SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>sts discretion in the court and that the exercise of 
discretion is subject to re<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew for abuse, some 
record articulation of the reasons for the court's choice to apply the 
percentage is necessary to facilitate that re<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew 
(see CPLR 4213[b]; Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, 
Book 7B, CPLR 4213:2, at 336 [meaningful re<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew is 
futile if court does not state facts upon which its decision rests]; see also 4 
Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Ci<SPAN class=highlight>v </SPAN>Prac § 4213.07 [court 
must pro<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>de the ultimate facts which support its 
conclusions of law "in order to enlighten the parties and to make more 
effecti<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN> the re<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>ew 
of judgments on appeal"]). The stated basis for an exercise of discretion to 
apply the formula to income o<SPAN class=highlight>ve</SPAN>r $80,000 should, in 
sum and substance, reflect both that the court has carefully considered the 
parties' circumstances and that it has found no reason why there should be a 
departure from the prescribed percentage.
<P>In the present case, the Hearing Examiner conducted a two- day inquiry into 
the parties' circumstances and set forth her findings in detail. The Appellate 
Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion was satisfied, as are we, that there was 
sufficient record indication that no extraordinary circumstances were present, 
and application of the statutory 17% to the $19,214 income abo<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN> $80,000 was therefore justified and not an abuse of 
discretion.
<P>Finally, we affirm as well the Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion's conclusion that the father is required to pay 
his pro rata share of the child's unreimbursed medical expenses. The statute 
specifies that the court "shall pro rate each parent's share of future 
reasonable health care expenses of the child not co<SPAN 
class=highlight>ve</SPAN>red by insurance" (Family Court Act § 413[1][c][5]). 
Defendant's insistence that this order constitutes an impermissible open- ended 
obligation, as the Second Department earlier held (see, e.g., <I>Chirls <SPAN 
class=highlight>v </SPAN>Chirls</I>, 170 AD2d 641) is meritless in light of the 
Act.
<P>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Di<SPAN 
class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion, insofar as appealed from, should be affirmed, 
with costs.
<P>F O O T N O T E S
<P><A name=n1a>1.</A> The propriety of the award of pri<SPAN

Appellate Di<SPAN class=highlight>vi</SPAN>sion, but is not before us on this 
appeal.<A href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I95_0113.htm#n1"

<P><A name=n2a>2.</A> The theory underlying the percentage-of-parental-income 
approach (rather than allocating the cost of pro<SPAN

children tend to <SPAN class=highlight>va</SPAN>ry according to parents' income 
(see, 2 Bronstein, New York Practice Guide, Domestic Relations § 
31.03[3][a][ii]). The actual percentages can be traced to a study of the typical 
portion of household income generally de<SPAN class=highlight>vo</SPAN>ted to 
the child (see Note, 56 Brooklyn L Re<SPAN class=highlight>v,</SPAN> supra, at 
1316-1319, citing <SPAN class=highlight>Va</SPAN>n der Gaag, On Measuring the
