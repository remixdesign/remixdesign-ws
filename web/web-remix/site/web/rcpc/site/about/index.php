Cox, Jr. practices law in New York State. Before earning his JD in 1993, Mr. Cox received a portion of his early education as a student participant in Project Upward Bound&reg; and A Better Chance&reg; — both college preparatory programs designed for youth advancement.</p><p>Cox is a husband, father, and was a brother to five sisters during his youth. Cox served as a commercial credit analyst, in the banking industry, as well as a marketing representative for IBM. Taking a radical left turn, after an interstate divorce and before attending law school, Cox studied human nature under the tutelage of two elderly barbershop sages of his community. While honing his barber skills and shaping the appearance of his customers, the author volunteered his free time to his community and analyzed the phenomenon of the absent-parent.</p><p>After years of thought and study, Cox concluded that "absenteeism" is the result of an insouciantly acceptable imbalance of assumptions in the relationship between parents. We Gotta Talk 'Baby' was born out of that conclusion. Cox became deeply cognizant that the human male and female are not independent, but interdependent—complements to a whole; and, that that 'whole' is being exploited. Exploited by the unweds' failure to have significant communications, leaving both individuals complaining, mostly unreasonably, throughout the family courts of our nation.</p><p>We Gotta Talk 'Baby' begins where legislation has fallen short. The author has developed and provides conceptual prototypes called a Notice of Pregnancy&copy; and Response to Notice of Pregnancy&copy; which he predicts will become legal standards in our lifetime. These documents address a need of prospective parents and families to communicate with each other, in writing, at the first meaningful instance a pregnancy is disclosed.</p><?php include ('../includes/footer.php');?>
