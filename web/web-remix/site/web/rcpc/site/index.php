Cox, Jr., promotes and advances this guide for unwed persons facing a recently disclosed pregnancy. Whether female, male, teen, or of an older generation, <em>We Gotta Talk, Baby: Making Responsible Choices in the 21st Century</em> challenges today's public policies and raises the ultimate constitutional issue surrounding family values, individual liberties and the interest of our posterity.</p><p>Cox introduces civil concepts of a <em><a href="offerings/#02">Notice of Pregnancy</a></em> and a <em><a href="offerings/#03">Response to Notice of Pregnancy</a></em>, drafted and issued by perspective parents (or grandparents) during the earliest stages of a pregnancy.  The notice and response are essentially a prelude to what Cox calls "prenatal-nuptials."  See, Family Ct. Act, Art. V, Sec. 516, New York State.</p><p>The forms, as illustrated in <em>We Gotta Talk, 'Baby'</em>, are constructed as a guide for future legal practitioners, single people and their families when informed of a recently revealed pregnancy. The proper use of the documents is consistent with basic concepts of law and foster respect, in addition to being a wholistic approach to family planning.</p><p>Robert Cox's story was profiled in <em>Newsday</em> on October 21, 2003.<br />Download Article: <a href="images/newsday_102103.pdf">pdf</a> <a href="images/newsday_102103.jpg">jpg</a></p><p class="caption"><em>We Gotta Talk 'Baby':</em> Making Responsible Choices in the 21st Century<br />&copy; 2005-2006 All rights reserved.<br />Publisher: Responsible Choices Publishing Co., Inc.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
