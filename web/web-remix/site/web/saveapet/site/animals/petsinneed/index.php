Since we operate strictly on donations, we are in desperate need of funds to help our sick dogs. Our medical bills average $2,000-3,000 per month not including unexpected illnesses or emergencies.</p><p>In the past few months we have taken 4 dogs that were heartworm positive. Two of the dogs were successfully treated and the other 2 will be treated soon. Heartworm treatment is not only physically hard on the dogs but also very expensive.</p><p>Recently we rescued our Bahamian friends from Grand Bahama. Hurricane Francis wiped them out and we have been treating 35 dogs for Erlichiosis (a tick born disease) and severe parasitic infections. The cost was over $3000 to help these desperate creatures. Your funds will help them get healthy and adopted.</p><p>One of the last pups left was "Cassie". She needed heart surgery or else she would have died. Luckily she was treated at Penn State and is now awaiting a happy, fun loving home. She will need periodic EKG's, but is expected to live a full life. She is on medication but no special diet restrictions. When we rescue an animal from the local shelter, we look for animals who we think will make good family pets. We also look at the animals that have been there for a long time and for what ever reason have been overlooked for adoption. We bring them to Save-A-Pet and get to know them. We work on obedience training, socialization and hope to find them good homes.</p><p>A big part of our mission is to help these otherwise neglected and overlooked animals find a good home for life; with that comes many medical and social problems. We depend on our volunteers to help with training and socializing. We could not do it without them and depend on donations to help with the unexpected medical problems.</p><p>If you would like to help us with these expenses please make a <a href="../../whatyoucando/donate/">Donate</a> either online with PayPal or by check.</p><?php include ('../../includes/footer.php');?>
