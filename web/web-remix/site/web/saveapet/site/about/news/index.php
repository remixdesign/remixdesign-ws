We have space for a spay/neuter clinic at our facility and are currently raising funds to begin the process. All the animals that leave our shelter must be spayed/neutered. We also have a feral cat program. These poor shadow cats need help. We trap them, spay and neuter them, vaccinate them and get them tested for diseases. We must curb the over population of feral cats on Long Island. Please donate funds for our clinic. It is a true community effort. Your donation of $30.00 will help build our clinic. Go to  <a href="../../whatyoucando/donate/">Donate</a> for more information.</p><h2>Microchip Your Pet</h2><p>Save-A-Pet is now available to do micro chipping at our shelter on Cost is $50 per animal. We will micro chip your dog or cat and register your pet in the national database. Micro chipping is a simple procedure that takes only a few seconds and it will help ensure your pets safe return home. If you are interested, please call for an appointment at 473-6333.</p><p>A micro chip is about the size of a grain of rice and is implanted under the skin via a syringe. When a pet is lost and winds up at a local shelter or veterinarian, a wand like scanner is waved over the dog to check for a micro chip. The scanner beeps telling you a microchip has been found and the animals chip number appears on the screen. One simple call to the national database, and your pet is safely returned. Remember, collars and tags can be lost but a micro chip lasts a life time.</p><p>For more information on micro chipping, go to <a href="http://www.homeagainid.com/">www.homeagainID.com</a>.</p><?php include ('../../includes/footer.php');?>
