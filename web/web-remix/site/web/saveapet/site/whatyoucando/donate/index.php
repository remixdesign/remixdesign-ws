We are asking people to put anything made out of cloth that you no longer need. We collect money per pound of clothing. You can help the animals by discarding your old clothes at Save-A-Pet!</p><h3>Empty Ink Cartridges and Used Cell Phones</h3><p>Save-A-Pet has started a program to collect empty ink cartridges from fax machines, copiers and printers. A local company has promised to give a cash donation to the shelter for the cartridges. This program can only become successful through the public donations of the cartridges. This is a great program for schools to initiate! Many local companies and schools throw out the empties! Just drop off the cartridges at Save-A-Pet or if you have a large amount and are local, we will pick them up. We are also collecting used cell phones. Any help that you would be willing to give us would be greatly appreciated by the animals at Save-A-Pet.</p><h3>Items Needed</h3><p>Save-A-Pet Animal Rescue is always in need of items for the shelter.
