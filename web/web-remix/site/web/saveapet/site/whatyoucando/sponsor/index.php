For just $30.00 per month you can sponsor a dog or cat until he/she is adopted. 100% of the donations go directly to the animals.</p><p>It will not only help defray the cost of their routine and medical care, but also will allow us to provide them with special toys, treats and bones. Although we receive donations of toys and treats and are very grateful, we only provide toys and bones that are appropriate and safe for that particular dog. Some dogs require hard rubber toys such as Kongs, while others can play with soft squeaky toys. We make sure all of our dogs and cats have the appropriate and safe toys to play with.</p><p>Not only is your sponsorship tax deductible, but you will also receive updates on your sponsored pet along with pictures every month. You can watch your sponsored pet as he/she progresses in training or socialization through updates and pictures until adopted.</p><p>Please consider sponsoring a pet, when you read the updates and see the pictures you can't help but smile.</p><?php include ('../../includes/footer.php');?>
