This also marked the start of production of the new Volkswagen luxury-class saloon that is to be lauWith its Transparent Factory, Volkswagen has become the first manufacturer to implement a production concept that combines the processes of classic industrial-scale automotive production with manual craft tasks. Another unique aspect of this factory is the fact that production can be followed live by the customer. The idea of the Transparent Factory was transformed into a building by Gunter Henn, the group of architects responsible for building the Autostadt in Wolfsburg.The new luxury-class Volkswagen will be built behind 27,500 square metres of glazed facades in a production area covering 55,000 square metres. The glazed areas and 24,000 square metres of parquetry create a light atmosphere which reflects the innovative underlying philosophy of manufacture by meticulously executed assembly processes, in many cases by hand, as a complement to industrial production processes.Production in the Transparent Factory will take place on several levels. The "slat belt is at the heart of the new production line. All that it has in common with conventional conveyors is its phased movement according to assembly stage. The surface of the slat belt itself consists of 29 individual elements that are also fully lined with parquetry and carry the vehicles to be assembled. Other features include an induction power supply and a new indirect lighting concept. All parts required for the assembly process accompany the corresponding vehicle in a "components basket.Volkswagen has likewise adopted a new approach in the form of the Event Area integrated into the factory. High tech is used here to help visitors and customers find out more about Volkswagen, its luxury-class models and individual mobility in general. Customers coming to Dresden to collect their new car will receive VIP treatment in a separate section of this area.Along with the construction of this factory close to the city centre, a new logistics system has been created. Specially developed tram cars (CarGoTram) provide an environmentally and traffic-friendly shuttle service using the city's municipal tram network, carrying prefabricated parts from the Logistics Centre outside the city to the Transparent Factory.The outdoor facilities, covering an area of some 50,000 square metres, fit in perfectly with the urban setting; around 6 million were spent on the factory's surroundings at Strassburger Platz, about 100 metres away from the Botanical Gardens. The factory's landmark is a glass tower, almost 40 metres high and visible from some considerable distance, in which the finished vehicles are stored ready for collection.--><div id="index"><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="600" id="index" ALIGN=""> <PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="index.swf"> <PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high> <PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#FFFFFF> <EMBED src="index.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#FFFFFF  WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="600" NAME="index" ALIGN="" TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></EMBED></OBJECT></div></BODY></HTML>
