In preparation 		for coloring, hair should be as dry as possible, straw-like even. Still, if you're saying to yourself "my hair can't handle this", then only dry 		the hair enough to take the water out, or if you're really paranoid, wait half a day or more to get the natural oil back in, or use conditioner 		when you wash. But if you've never had problems with damaged hair, you should be able to handle it. <!--(still confused on this ;.;)--></p>				<img src="images/color_applying.gif" width="330" height="24" alt="1)Applying" />				<p>Make sure hair is combed and detangled. apply vaseline to hairline, back of neck, and ears. some drugstore boxed dyes have to be mixed and 		developed, so just follow the instructions for that. apply dye (make sure to pick up layers, try to have someone else do it). as with the bleach, 		saturate the hair, check for spots with a hand mirror, and comb it out to even out the distribution, then check again. Using a comb to spread it 		evenly will help. clean off your face and hands with isopropyl alcohol. careful when touching things. have a good amount of counter space available 		with a towel on top. Our bathroom is tiny, so I place the towel in the sink.</p>				<img src="images/color_setting.gif" width="330" height="24" alt="2)Setting" />				<p>Apply saran wrap, or plastic bag. you'll look dumb, but this really helps it set, because the dye is staying on your head without drying. hold on 		tightly with ties and clips, no air in the plastic. it's very easy to wear if you've got in on snug. heat with blow dryer, holding the blow dryer not 		too close to your head. The plastic can take a fair amount of heat, but of course, too much and it will melt. set for at least three hours. Hell, 		I've fallen asleep with the plastic on (laying on my back of course).  If you don't want to take a hair drier to apply heat to setting dye, wrap a 		towel around your head. That will keep your body heat in and help set the dye.</p>		<p>Remove plastic, blow dry till dry and stiff. pick up layers and check that everywhere is dry. When you wash it, don't use shampoo (but what about 		the excess?), condition, optional leave-in conditioner. clean up your bathroom with any bleach cleaner: Ajax, regular bleach.</p>				<p>Don't shampoo your hair for a few days after you dye. This will help get your natural oils back. Only water and conditioner. <!--(???)--></p>				<p>Color highlighting can be done using the cap or foil method mentioned in the Bleach section. Set times are the same for the regular coloring method above.</p>				<a href="care.html">		<img src="images/color_next.gif" width="330" height="20" alt="Next&gt;Care" /></a>				<p>&nbsp;</p>				<p>&nbsp;</p>				<p>&nbsp;</p>				<p>&nbsp;</p>				<p>&nbsp;</p>				<p>&nbsp;</p></div>		</div></div></body></html>
