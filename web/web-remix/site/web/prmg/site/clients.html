Flint, he stumbled upon a babbling mountain spring. Thirsty, he knelt down and sampled the water. The delightful taste transported Giovanni to the days of his youth when he often drank from the fountains of his village, which drew water from ancient Roman aqueducts. For many years the men bottled the secret spring water to share with their friends and loved ones on special occasions. After three generations, encouraged by the accolades the water received, the Flint family formed Green Mountain Springs and began their quest to "the thirst of the world...one drop at a time."</p><h3><a href="http://www.sbpli-lifirst.org/" target="_blank">School-Business Partnership of Long Island</a></h3><a href="http://www.sbpli-lifirst.org/" target="_blank"><img src="images/sbplilogo.gif" width="150" height="110" align="right" alt="SBPLI logo" /></a><p>Fred Breithut founded SBPLI in 1984 with the goal of developing partnerships between local high schools and businesses that would provide students with practical experience and curriculum development, while helping the business community develop its future workforce.
