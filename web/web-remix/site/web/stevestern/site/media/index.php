The lawsuit followed <strong>personal efforts by Frank Gargano to register new voters into the Working Families Party, securing their application for absentee ballots and then personally picking up such ballots from the Board of Elections.</strong></p><p>The lawsuit was filed to prevent what Stern called a "concerted attempt to disenfranchise those citizens who come out and cast their honest ballot" and to "unduly influence the outcome" of the Working Families primary election held on Tuesday by Stern's Republican/Conservative opponent, Frank Gargano.</p><p><strong>On election day, as the result of canvassing efforts, it is alleged that several voters were identified as having been able to vote in person during the primary, thus supporting allegations that the absentee ballots were secured fraudulently.</strong> A significant number of voters were either found to be at home or said to be at work. In addition, several supposed absentee voters were believed to have voted in person at the polls, thus invalidating their absentee ballot, yet supporting the Stern campaign's allegations of voter fraud.</p><p>As a result of the legal action, it was ordered that the absentee ballots and voting machines were to be impounded. A hearing is scheduled for September 29th. At that time, evidence collected on election day will be presented and the validity of sworn statements by absentee voters will be scrutinized.</p><p>Specifically, the action filed on Monday claims:</p><p>That Gargano personally picked up and distributed absentee ballot applications for persons who were not registered voters. New York State Election Law clearly provides that only those who are registered voters may apply to vote by absentee ballot. The lawsuit alleges that the applications for absentee ballot were signed by persons who were not registered voters at the time.</p><p>That Gargano and his campaign used undue influence by personally registering voters into the Working Families Party, personally caused them to sign applications for absentee ballots and personally delivering those ballots to the voters he registered.</p><p>That almost every voter Gargano registered to the Working Families Party also applied to vote by absentee ballot. It is statistically impossible that practically all of those persons would, in "good faith", not be able to vote through the normal process on Election Day. In fact, due to Gargano, approximately 20% of the Working Families Party members in the 16th Legislative District are now voting by absentee ballot.</p><p>"It is common sense", Stern said, that this was a scheme by Gargano to literally stuff the ballot box.</p><p>"It is unconscionable that the Conservative Republican Gargano, who displayed a total disregard for the nominating process by not even screening with the Working Families Party, has instead masterminded this despicable effort to steal the line by stuffing the Working Families Party and the ballot box with his friends and neighbors," Stern added.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this is yet another example of Gargano's troubling pattern of unethical behavior."</p><p>Gargano and his business activities continue to be a focus of the District Attorney's investigation of the Suffolk Nassau Chamber of Commerce at Huntington.</p>  <p>*A copy of the lawsuit is available upon request.</p><hr /><p>September 13, 2005</p><p>Contact:<br />John Zaher, PRMG<br />(631) 207-1057; cell (631) 375-8770</p><h2><a name="091305">Stern Charges Gargano Campaign with Voter Fraud</a></h2><h3>Democratic Candidate for Suffolk County Legislature Files Lawsuit to Preserve the Integrity of the Primary Election</h3><p>Central Islip, NY-Steve Stern, Democratic candidate for the Suffolk County Legislature, filed a lawsuit yesterday in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County to prevent what he called a "concerted attempt to disenfranchise those citizens who come out and cast their honest ballot" and to "unduly influence the outcome" of the primary election to be held today, September 13th, by his Republican/Conservative opponent, Frank Gargano.</p><p>The proceeding alleges that Gargano and his campaign have attempted to literally steal the Working Families Party line by abusing the absentee ballot procedure.

The plan comes as gas prices continue to spike and the winter heating season nears. The four point plan includes:<p><em>Formation of a County Gas/Oil Price Gouging Task Force.</em><br />Restrict gas stations from increasing prices more than once during a 24 hour time period.<br />Set aside a portion of excess sales tax revenue from high gas and heating oil prices to provide an enhanced County HEAP program to eligible County residents to offset rising fuel costs.<br />Seek State legislation to change from a sales tax on gas and heating oil to cap the tax on a gallon of gas, specifically applying the 8.625% combined sales tax to the first $1.50 per gallon, saving taxpayers and prevent the state/county from receiving a windfall in tax revenues at consumer expense.</p><p>"This plan would provide Suffolk County residents with needed protection against price gouging, while providing tax relief and assistance to those who will be struggling to meet rising home heating costs," said Steve Stern.</p><p>The first two points of the plan seek to prevent gas and oil price gouging. Stern proposes that Suffolk County create a Gas/Oil Price Gouging Task Force. The Task Force would consist of representatives from the County Office of Consumer Affairs, Suffolk County Police Department, Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. It would be charged with investigating and prosecuting instances of price gouging under New York State law. The second component to prevent price gouging would be the creation of a local law to prevent gas stations from increasing prices more than once in a 24 hour time period. Considering that gas stations do not receive deliveries more than once daily, price changes of more than once daily would be indicative of price gouging, where the gas station would be receiving a windfall as compared to price paid upon delivery.</p><p>The third point of the plan would set aside a portion of excess sales tax revenue received as the result of rising gas and home heating oil prices to form a fund to provide a Suffolk County Enhanced HEAP (Home Energy Assistance Program). The federal/state funded program administered by Suffolk County provides cash payments to low income residents, who are often seniors on fixed incomes, to offset the costs of home heating.  The proposed fund would increase payments to offset rising prices and/or expand eligibility to cover more persons struggling to meet rising heating costs.</p><p>"I urge Legislators and the County Executive to take action now, before the heating season begins, to set aside a portion of this year's surpluses to provide enhanced home heating assistance to county residents before those most vulnerable, especially seniors, have to make tough choices to keep up with rising costs," said Stern.</p><p>The fourth point would provide long-term relief by changing the sales tax on gas and home heating oil to a cap on a gallon of gas/oil purchased.  For instance, the sales tax could be capped at $1.50, providing a combined $.129 in tax revenue to the county and state combined, or $2.59 per 20 gallon fill-up. This compares to $.285 per gallon when applied to the full amount at $3.30 per gallon price of gas, thus providing the state/county with a combined $5.69 in sales tax revenue per 20 gallon fill-up. This illustrates the current windfall the state and counties are currently receiving from higher gas and oil prices.</p><hr /><p>September 2, 2005</p><p>Contact:<br />John Zaher, PRMG<br />(631) 207-1057; cell (631) 375-8770</p><h2><a name="090205">Stern Applauds State Decision to Eliminate Commack and Wicks Roads as Access for Commercial Truck Traffic to Proposed Long Island Truck and Rail Intermodal Facility</a></h2><p>Dix Hills, N.Y. - Steve Stern, Democratic and Working Families candidate for the 16th Suffolk County Legislative District, today applauded a decision by New York State officials to eliminate Commack and Wicks roads from any further consideration as access points for commercial truck traffic to the proposed Long Island Truck and Rail Intermodal Facility.</p><p>While hailing the elimination of Commack and Wicks roads, Stern today called on the New York State Department of Transportation to also eliminate any use whatsoever of Crooked Hill Road. If the project is to move forward, Stern said access must be provided through the DOT's Alternative No. 2 - new one-way roadways built adjacent to the Sagtikos State Parkway with direct connections to the Long Island Expressway.</p><p>To provide much-needed relief to the Commack and Dix Hills neighborhoods along Commack Road, Stern said that if new one-way roadways are constructed, commercial truck traffic should be directed off Commack Road near these neighborhoods and diverted to the Intermodal Facility roadways.</p><p>"While the DOT should be commended for eliminating Commack and Wicks roads as potential access points, it is imperative that Crooked Hill Road also be eliminated as an access alternative," Stern said.  "While I support efforts to reduce commercial truck traffic on Long Island roadways through an increase in rail use, it is crucial that these neighborhoods are protected from any adverse impacts."</p><p>In order to reduce truck traffic on Long Island, the DOT proposes to build the Long Island Truck and Rail Intermodal Facility on a portion of the property once used by the Pilgrim State Hospital in the Town of Islip. Utilizing the existing Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) track and the existing rail siding right of way, freight would be delivered via train to the site, then transferred to trucks for local delivery - and vice versa.</p><p>Stern said several pending projects, including a new Wal-Mart on Crooked Hill Road and the proposed Tanger outlet in Babylon, have the potential to cause greater congestion on local roadways. "Residents in Dix Hills, Commack, and Deer Park are under siege from proposed commercial development," Stern said. "Enough is enough. If this Intermodal Facility is approved, there is no way local roads will be able to handle any increase in commercial traffic."</p><hr /><p>August 30, 2005</p><p>Contact:<br />John Zaher, PRMG<br />(631) 207-1057; cell (631) 375-8770</p><h2><a name="083005">Steve Stern Calls for the Acquisition of the Pidgeon Hill Woodlands</a></h2><p>Huntington, NY- Steve Stern joined environmentalist Adrienne Esposito, Executive Director of the Citizen's Campaign for the Environment, and other local activists today as he called for the County acquisition of the Pidgeon Hill Woodlands.</p><img src="../images/8-30_1.jpg" width="200" height="143" align="right" alt="Steve Stern, August 30 2005" /><p>"With so much overdevelopment and urban sprawl, we can't afford to let this environmental treasure fall into the hands of developers.

The statements were made in reference to the county's role in the approval process concerning an expansion project on a presently vacant 40 plus acre plot between Crooked Hill Road and the Sunken Meadow Parkway in Smithtown.</p><img src="../images/7-29_1.jpg" width="200" height="143" align="right" alt="Steve Stern, July 29 2005" /><p>Stern went on to describe how he has been constructively working on the issue by meeting with community members and by expressing his and the community's concerns at Zoning Board of Appeals meeting held on July 12th regarding the project. Throughout which he sought to not make it a political issue. However, after Gargano's false statements, he felt he must speak out.</p><p>"While Mr. Binder was either sleeping or holding press conferences, the County Executive and the Suffolk County Planning Commission was doing its job by registering their disapproval and citing an over-saturation of this kind of development in the Huntington and Smithtown areas. The commission recommended against the Walmart construction finding it an 'unwarranted further proliferation and intensification of commercial development' in our community," said Stern. <strong>"Instead, seeking political advantage, Binder and Gargano have now attacked the County Executive without taking any constructive action. For Mr. Gargano, the issue does not matter, its all about the show,"</strong> continued Stern.</p><p>Stern went on to call for community input and county oversight on a commercial development plan in Commack that has turned Commack Road into the Mason-Dixon line in a zoning war between the towns of Smithtown and Huntington.</p><p>The new stores would undoubtedly bring an increase in traffic along Commack Road, as well as a rise in light, noise and environmental pollution, Stern said, that would be most detrimental to seemingly voiceless residents who live in the Town of Huntington.</p><p>"Needless to say, the quality of life of local residents would be greatly impacted," Stern said. "Further, these additional big box stores are certain to impact local businesses and downtown areas."</p><p>The tension that has resulted from the development's proximity to the Smithtown-Huntington border could be alleviated through county oversight of building projects along town borders.</p><img src="../images/7-29_2.jpg" width="200" height="141" align="left" alt="Steve Stern, July 29 2005" /><p>"Considering Suffolk County's limited open space and the vital efforts our county has undertaken to preserve such space, Suffolk County must be involved when a project affects bordering communities," Stern contended. "For this reason, I am urging the adoption of legislation that would require a neighboring town to inform residents outside of that town about rezoning, public hearings, development, etc. when the homes outside the town is a certain distance from the town with jurisdiction. I would also require a representative from the town where the rezone is occurring or the applicant to appear before the Town Board of the neighboring town and publicly notify them," said Stern.</p><p>Stern has raised concern over proposed developments at the former EDO site in Deer Park and the Pilgrim State property in Brentwood. "I am recommending that a comprehensive study of impact on all future development within this corridor be undertaken," said the County Executive. Stern agreed, "If we don't take action now, Western Suffolk will increasingly look like Nassau and Queens counties," said Stern.</p><p>Stern attended the July 12 meeting of the Town of Smithtown Board of Zoning Appeals and expressed his concerns to counsel for the Board of Zoning Appeals and expressed how the residents of neighboring community were not aware of the project. Stern is calling on area residents to attend the board's next meeting, at the Smithtown Senior Citizen Center (420 Middle Country Road, Smithtown) at 7 p.m. on September 13.</p><p>"With your help, our voices will be heard," Stern told residents. "Regardless of your feelings about the proposed development, the Board of Zoning Appeals and the developer must learn that our input is important."</p><?phpinclude ("../includes/bottom.php");?>
