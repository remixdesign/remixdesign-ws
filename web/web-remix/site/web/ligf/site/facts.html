The "BigCat Encounter" features the world famous Rosaires and their family with their rescued lions and tigers.</p><p>Native to the Sub-Sahara African Grasslands, the roar of an African Lion can be heard up to five miles away. Not only does it protect against intruders butit also is an efficient way of gathering all of the family members. Lions travelin what is called a "pride"; this group can include up to 50 familymembers. Adult lions can grow up to 500 pounds and 8 feet in length. Once theyreach sexual maturity at the age of 4, the lionesses enter the breedingseason together so that they can give birth at the same time and share nursingduties with each other. African Lions reside at the top of the food chainin their habitat and are carnivorous. Of all the hunting events which take place,only about one fourth are successful efforts. When feeding time arrives themale lions eat first, then the lionesses, and finally their cubs are able to feaston the leftovers. Once they have survived as cubs, African Lions canlive over 15 years.</p><h2><a name="alligators" id="alligators">Alligators</a></h2><img src="images/gator_teeth.jpg" width="219" height="162" class="photo" align="right" alt="Alligator" /> <p>The once endangered alligator dates back over 65 millionyears. The only two places in the world where this reptileexists are the southeast United States and China. Inthe 1960s the American Alligator, which usually livesup to 50 years in the wild, was on the brink of extinctionbecause of poachers who killed them in return for high pricesfrom those who wanted to make goods out of their valuableskin. Federal regulations were enforced in 1970 and the alligatorpopulation quickly rose to make the conservation effort themost successful in history. Alligators are quick, agile,and because of their quick bursts of speed, can outrun ahorse for a distance of 30 feet. Dubbed "El Legarto"(whichmeans Big Lizard) by European Settlers, these carnivoresare known for their short, blunt snout, which is part ofa very powerful jaw. Their teeth are conically shaped,made particularly for grabbing and holding as opposed tocutting, which explains why they swallow all of their food (whichinclude fish, turtles, small mammals, and even smalleralligators) whole. The reproduction process starts whenan alligator reaches the length of 6 feet. Once the females have mated,they move to a marshy area to build a nest to lay and guardtheir eggs, which number on average about 45. The incubationperiod lasts 65 days and once all of the babies are hatched,they must begin to live in the wild. The first couple ofyears before an alligator reaches 4 feet are the most dangerousbecause they are prey to many other animals; after thatperiod, it becomes a predator reaching lengths of up to14 feet long and weights up to 1,000 pounds.</p><h2><a name="aoudads" id="aoudasd">Aoudads</a></h2><img src="images/aoudads.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="photo" align="right" alt="Aoudads" /><p>The Aoudad, also known as the Barbary Sheep, is a goat-antelope found in the rocky mountains of North Africa. Aoudads stand 30 to 40 inches at the shoulder and weigh from 90 to 310 pounds. Aoudads are sandy brown with a slightly lighter underbelly. Shaggy hair coats the throat, which extends down to the chest in males. They also have a sparse mane. Aoudad horns have a triangular cross-section. The horns curve outwards, backwards and then inwards. Horns reach up to 20 inches.</p> <p>Aoudads are found in arid mountainous areas. They are herbivores and remain solitary, for the most part. They eat grass, bushes, lichen and acacia. They are crepuscular, meaning that they are active in the early morning and late afternoon, but resting in the heat of the day. They are very agile and can jump over eight feet from a standing stop.</p><h2><a name="buffalo" id="buffalo">Buffalo</a></h2><img src="images/buffalo.jpg" width="200" height="170" class="photo" align="right" alt="Camel" /> <p>Buffalo were originally found on the American prairie. Atpresent, however, their range is very restricted. The Buffalois found in national parks of the UnitedStates and Canada. Earlier, when the population of this animal was larger, theherds traveled long distances in search of food. Today, one can see paths leftby millions of Buffalo Bison hooves. The buffalo has a large head and neck andhumped shoulders. Also known as the "American bison", the buffalois brownish-black, except on the hind part of the body, which is brown. Long,coarse hair covers the head, neck, and hump. The hair forms a beard on the throatand chin. The head has a pair of horns like those of domestic cattle. Some pairsof horns spread 35 inches at their widest point. A full-grown bull (male) measuresup to 12 1/2 feet long, from the tip of its nose to the end of its short, tuftedtail. Its height at the shoulders measures 6 feet. Bulls usually weigh between1,600 and 2,000 pounds. Buffalo are grazing animals; their feeding behavior issimilar to that of domestic stock. They feed on grasses and other ground forage.When buffalo (bison) were abundant, they influenced the ecosystem greatly. Theirwallows served as temporary water resources for other animals. Through dung productionthey also contributed to creating the rich soils of the prairies. Buffalo livein small groups arranged by sex, age, and habitat. Cow groups consist of females,calves, and a few males. There is a tendency to develop dominance in groups.Males that are older and have a higher rank and breed more often than the othergroup members. Buffalo groups may be seen during grazing and traveling.They travel in a line. These animals make good swimmers and runners. Buffaloare capable of reaching speeds of about 62 km per hour.</p>            <h2><a name="camels" id="camels">Camels</a></h2><img src="images/camel.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="photo" align="right" alt="Buffalo" /> <p>Domesticated thousands of years ago by perfume traders, thecamel went on to become the desert dweller's primary sourceof transport, shade, milk, meat, wool and hides. They arestill used in many parts of Africa and Asia today to pull ploughs, turn waterwheels, and transport people and goodsto market along desert routes unreachable by motor vehicles.A fully-grown camel can weigh over 1500lbs. and reach a height of 6 feet. Camels have the reputation of being bad-tempered,moody creatures who spit and kick. In reality, they tend to be good-tempered,patient and intelligent. The ears of the camel are linedwith fur to keep out dust and desert wind. Their thickeyebrows and long, curly, eyelashes also serve this purpose.These mammals need very little water if their regular diet containsgood, moisture-rich pasture. Although camels can withstandsevere dehydration, a large animal can drink as much as21 gallons in ten minutes, an amount that would kill anyother mammal. But the camel's unique metabolism enables the animalto store the water in its bloodstream. Contrary to popularbelief, a camel does not store water in its hump. It isin fact a mound of fatty tissue from which the animal drawsenergy when food is hard to find. The normal life span ofa camel is 40 years, although a working camel retires from active duty at 25.</p><h2><a name="fallowdeer" id="fallowdeer">Fallow Deer</a></h2><img src="images/deer.jpg" width="200" height="186" class="photo" align="right" alt="Fallow Deer" /><p>The Fallow Deer is a ruminant mammal belonging to the family Cervidae. It has a brown coat with white mottles that are most pronounced in the summertime. Variants that are completely white or completely black have been known, but are very rare in the wild.</p><p>The Fallow Deer is over 4 feet long, with a 7-inch tail. It can weigh up to 220 pounds. Its antlers are broad and shovel-like. Its habitat is mixed woodland and open grassland. The males stay on their own and only join the females when in rut at the end of October.</p><p>The fallow deer was spread across central Europe and Britain by the Romans. The Normans kept them for hunting in the royal forests. Since the 18th century, they were released into the wild for hunting purposes. The fallow deer is easily tamed and is often kept semi-domesticated in parks today, like those at the Long Island Game Farm.</p><h2><a name="giraffe" id="giraffe">Giraffe</a></h2><img src="images/gerry_bday04c_sm.jpg" width="219" height="290" class="photo" align="right" alt="Giraffe" /><p>This year, the Game Farm will be celebrating the 9th birthdayof Gerry, our beloved "gentle giant."</p><p>Giraffes are the tallest living land mammals in the worldsince the dinosaurs. During their 25 yearlifespan, they will on average weigh one ton and grow tobe 19 feet tall. Their natural habitats are the woodlandssouth of the Sahara Desert and the African Savannah. Veryrarely will giraffes ever lie down; they even sleep andgive birth while standing up. Since they can survive onthe water naturally stored in plants, their strictly vegetarian dietallows them to go without water for several weeks. Thefemale usually endures a fifteen month pregnancy aroundthe age of eight. Her kin will grow for up to four feet in thefirst year of life. Because of their incredible heightgiraffes may sometimes find it hard to stretch their long necksfar enough to reach things close to the ground such asfood and water. Their tongues which can be up to 21 inches longcome in handy for this purpose. Like fingerprints, no twogiraffes have the same spot pattern on their bodies. Scientistsoriginally concluded that giraffes do not make sounds tocommunicate with each other. Despite these observations, new researchhas shown that giraffes certainly do make sounds, but theyare not able to be heard by the human ear.</p><br class="clear" /><h2><a name="kinkajous" id="kinkajous">Kinkajous</a></h2><img src="images/kinkajou.jpg" width="200" height="211" class="photo" align="right" alt="Kinkajou" /><p>The Kinkajou, also known as the Honey Bear, is a nocturnal rainforest mammal related to the raccoons. It is the only member of the genus Potos. An adult Kinkajou usually weighs only five to six pounds.</p><p>Though classified as a carnivore and equipped with sharp teeth, Kinkajous prefer to eat fruit and honey. Living in South American trees, they are not a particularly rare animal but they are not often seen by people. Like raccoons, kinkajous have remarkable ability for manipulating objects, rivaling that of primates.</p><br class="clear" /><h2><a name="llamas" id="llamas">Llamas</a></h2><img src="images/llama.jpg" width="200" height="201" class="photo" align="right" alt="Llama" /><p>Llama is a term used by the Peruvians to designate one of a small group of closely allied animals, which were the only domesticated hooved animals in the country prior to the Spanish conquest of the Americas. They were kept not only for their value as beasts of burden, but also for their flesh, hides, and wool. In fact, llamas were used in place of the horse, the ox, the goat, and the sheep. Llamas are now seeing increasing use in North America as clothing-fiber producing animals and as guard animals for sheep herds, which they protect from coyote attacks.</p><p>The skull generally resembles that of a camel, with relatively larger brain-cavity and orbits and less developed cranial ridges. The ears are rather long and pointed. There is no dorsal hump. Feet are narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having a distinct plantar pad. The tail is short, and fur is long and woolly.</p><p>Many llamas are easily annoyed. If annoyed they make a clucking noise as they are spitting up stomach acid. The disagreeable habit of spitting in the face of persons whose presence annoys them is common to all llamas.</p><h2><a name="monkeys" id="monkeys">Monkeys</a></h2><p>The Long Island Game Farm is home to a variety of monkeyspecies, all of which can be classified as new world monkeys.</p><p>New World monkeys are native to tropical forest environmentsof Southern Mexico, Central, and South America. Thisgroup includes the <strong>Squirrel, Spider, Vervet,</strong>and <strong>Capuchin</strong>, all of which can be found at the Game Farm. Some of themare as large as medium-sized dogs, but most are smaller.They range in weight from 1.5 to 33 pounds. Social groupsize vary from that of the <strong>Squirrel</strong> monkey, whichlives in troops of up to 500 individuals, to that of thenight monkey, which lives in small family groups. Monkeys are very enterprisingwhen it comes to obtaining food. For instance, <strong>Capuchin</strong> monkeysventure out of the trees to hunt crabs, clams, andother small animals in mangrove swamps. They also huntlarge insects and collect birds' eggs in the treesin addition to eating leaves and fruit. <strong>Capuchins</strong> can be easilytrained and have recently served as aids for quadriplegics.Female <strong>Vervet</strong> monkeys have a more active leadingrole than males.</p><br class="clear" /><h2><a name="peacocks" id="peacocks">Peacocks</a></h2><img src="images/peacocks.jpg" width="200" height="267" class="photo" align="right" alt="Peacocks" /><p>The Peacock, perhaps best known in popular culture as the colorful inspiration for the logo for the NBC television network, are in nature omnivorous. They consume plant parts, flower petals and seed heads when available, but prefer to eat insects and other arthropods. Vegetable matter provides peacocks with the necessary fiber required to digest hard scales and bones of small reptiles.</p><p>The male has beautiful iridescent blue-green or green coloured plumage. His tail feathers have a series of eyes that are best seen when the tail is fanned. Both species have a head crest. The female has a mixture of dull green, brown and grey in her plumage. She lacks the long tail of the male, but has a crest.</p><p>Peafowl are capable of reproducing at the age of two. Peacocks do not reach full maturity until one year later. At the age of two, the feathers are not fully developed in length and density. While peacocks at that age are physiologically able to mate, they have very little chance of competing with the older peacocks that have larger feathers.</p><h2><a name="lemurs" id="lemurs">Ring-Tailed Lemurs</a></h2><img src="images/lemur_baby.jpg" width="200" height="232" class="photo" align="right" alt="Lemur" /><p>Each spring newborns join our growing colony of Ring-Tailed Lemurs. It is nowthe fourth consecutive year of lemur births at the Game Farm, the only ever bornon Long Island.</p><p>The Ring-Tailed Lemurs are natives of the southern tip of Madagascar. They werenamed for their eye-catching black and white tails ringed with thirteen alternatingbands. The Ring-Tailed Lemur is a day-active primate and is one of the most terrestrialspecies of lemurs native to Madagascar. They inhabit the dry scrub and deciduousforests of south and southwestern part of Madagascar. Lemurs live in groups ofthree to twenty individuals. Females are dominant over males and remain in theirbirth groups. Infants begin riding on their mothers' backs within two weeks ofbirth. However, in spite of such close contact, only about 40 percent reach maturity.Lemurs eat flowers, fruit, occasional insects and small invertebrate prey. Theygrow to weigh between 6.5 - 7.5 pounds and live up to 20-25 years.</p><br class="clear" /><h2><a name="tigers" id="tigers">Tigers</a></h2><img src="images/tiger.jpg" width="200" height="167" class="photo" align="right" alt="Tiger" /><p>Returning for its third year, the Long Island Game Farm is proud to present "The Big Cat Encounter".The show runs twice daily weekdays, and three times daily during weekends. The "BigCat Encounter" features the world famous Rosaires and their familywith their rescued lions and tigers.</p><p>There are five species of tigers of the genus Panthera.In the more common species, including the Bengaland Indian tigers, adult males reach lengths up to 10 feetand often weigh in excess of 550 pounds. The tiger's physique reflects many evolutionaryadaptations for the capture and killing of large prey. Its hind legs arelonger than its front legs as an adaptation for jumping. Their shoulders areheavily muscled; the forepaws are equipped with long sharp retractile claws;and the skull is foreshortened, increasing the crushing leverage of the jaws.While the tiger's stripes make it stand out when away from its natural habitat,they are a perfect camouflage in the elephant grass and brush where it stalksits prey. The coat coloration disrupts the outline of the body as the hunterstalks or lies in ambush for its prey. Tigers occasionally take very large preysuch as rhino and elephant calves, as well as agricultural stock when wild preyis depleted. Tigers hunt alone, and actively search for prey rather then waitfor it. When it comes to reproduction, the female tiger takes the initiativeby moaning and roaring to get the attention of the males. After a gestation periodaveraging 104 days, a litter of two to five cubs is born with an average of twosurviving to adulthood. A cub's eyes open during the second week of life and itbegins to supplement its mother's milk with meat at about eight weeksof age, becoming totally independent by 18 months. The range of the tiger hasundergone a drastic reduction. In the early 1900s there were in excess of 100,000tigers in their native Asia, including about 40,000 in India. By the early 1970sthe world population of these cats had been reduced to as few as 4,000.</p><h2><a name="zebras" id="zebras">Zebras</a></h2><img src="images/zebra.jpg" width="200" height="267" class="photo" align="right" alt="Zebra" /><p>Zebras are black-and-white striped animals that live primarily in the savannaof Africa. The zebra is smaller in size than the horse, with a short uprightmane, large ears and tufted tail. Zebras are herbivores; they graze on siliceousgrasses, which rapidly wears down their teeth. All zebras have three forms ofdefense against predators. The first is their stripes, which vary for each speciesbut no two zebras have the same stripes. When running or grazing in a herd thezebras' stripes blend together to confuse its predator. Second is their ability to runup to 40 mph. Third is their powerful kick which is capable of crushingand killing a lion. These beautiful animals are endangered having been huntedfor their skins and used for food. Today they share their grazing land with humansand domesticated herds of sheep and cattle. Zebras are also susceptible to diseasesintroduced by domestic equine stock. Their life expectancy is twenty years, andan adult may grow to a height of over five feet, and weigh 800 pounds.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing="0">  <tr>     <td class="footer" bgcolor="#666600"><a href="about.html" >About the Zoo</a></td>    <td class="footer" bgcolor="#660000"><a href="visitor.html">Visitor Info</a></td>	<td class="footer" bgcolor="#000066"><a href="manorville.html">Visiting Manorville</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#003300" class="footer"><a href="bigcat.html">Big Cat Encounter</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#999900" class="footer"><a href="field.html">Field Trips</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#669933" class="footer"><a href="events.html">Zoo Events</a></td>    <td class="footer" bgcolor="#CC9933"><a href="facts.html">Animal Facts</a></td>	<td class="footer" bgcolor="#FF9933"><a href="employment.html">Employment</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#663300" class="footer"><a href="camp_zoo.html">Camp Zoo</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#990000" class="footer"><a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
