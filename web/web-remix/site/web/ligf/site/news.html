The contest winner will receive a Big Cat Giveaway Family Four Pack which includes free admission to the Game Farm for two adults and two children and a picture taken with the kinkajous.</p><p>"This contest is a fun way for the kids to get involved with the animals. Gentle Gerry the Giraffe was named by one of our park guests," said Diane Novak, Co-owner of the Long Island Game Farm.

I know that its going to be very difficult to pick a winner from all of the creative entries that we are sure to receive."</p><h2>Long Island Game Farm Welcomes<br />Jackson and Sheila the Kangaroos</h2><img src="http://www.longislandgamefarm.com/email/kangaroos.jpg" width="150" height="113" class="photo" align="left" alt="Kangaroos" /><p>The Long Island Game Farm is welcoming its new editions, Jackson and Sheila, Red Kangaroos, to the park for the 2005 season.

This will mark the Game Farm's 36th year of providing high quality fun and education to families throughout Long Island.</p><p>From alligators to lemurs to zebra and scores of animals in between, the Long Island Game Farm Wildlife and Children's Zoo has many interactive areas where guests can touch and, unlike most zoos, actually feed the animals! During the summer season, a 500 seat amphitheater serves as center stage for entertainment and educational programs. Children can also enjoy one of the carnival-style rides such as the carousel, Rio Grande Train, or Teacups. The Game Farm offers pony rides as well. The "Big Cat Encounter" will return for its third season in the Game Farm's 500 seat Amphitheater from May 28th through September 5th with two daily showings during weekdays and three showings on weekends. During the months of July and August, a week-long children's camp - Camp Zoo will return.</p><p>"We are very excited to begin our 36th season of serving the Long Island regional community. Our Park provides an ideal moderate-cost destination where the whole family can learn and interact with nature and the animal kingdom.  Again, this year, thousands of young students will pass through our park and learn first-hand about what they are taught in school," said Diane Novak, Co-Owner and President of the Long Island Game Farm.</p><p>One of the best times of the year to visit the Game Farm is early Spring, when many of the animals have given birth to newborns. This year's newborns include Barbados Sheep, donkeys, rabbits, sheep, ducks, goats, as well as several Ring-Tailed Lemurs. In the past four years, 10 baby lemurs have been born in the Long Island Game Farm.</p><p>"It only takes a few minutes at the Game Farm at this time of the year to enjoy the miracle of Spring as you interact with all of the newborns around the park," said Novak.</p><p>The Game Farm continues to plan its 2005 special events. This year's events will include Gentle Gerry the Giraffe's Birthday, Save the Cats Day, Child Safety Day, Autism Awareness Day, Breast Cancer Awareness Day, and a Harvest Festival.</p></td></tr></table><table cellspacing="0">  <tr>     <td class="footer" bgcolor="#666600"><a href="about.html" >About the Zoo</a></td>    <td class="footer" bgcolor="#660000"><a href="visitor.html">Visitor Info</a></td>	<td class="footer" bgcolor="#000066"><a href="manorville.html">Visiting Manorville</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#003300" class="footer"><a href="bigcat.html">Big Cat Encounter</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#999900" class="footer"><a href="field.html">Field Trips</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#669933" class="footer"><a href="events.html">Zoo Events</a></td>    <td class="footer" bgcolor="#CC9933"><a href="facts.html">Animal Facts</a></td>	<td class="footer" bgcolor="#FF9933"><a href="employment.html">Employment</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#663300" class="footer"><a href="camp_zoo.html">Camp Zoo</a></td>    <td bgcolor="#990000" class="footer"><a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
