Since then it has held numerous lectures to increase earlydetection and inform Long Islanders about medical advances and how to livehealthier. It has also developed ongoing programs to provide cancer patientsand survivors with the assistance they need to overcome cancer throughcomplementary integrative modalities that meet their psychosocial needs.These include a monthly support group, art therapy, massage therapy, andyoga. Under the guidance of its Executive Director, Lynda Distler, theCenter has established one of the region's most active cancer support andwellness programs.</p><?php include ('footer.php');?>
