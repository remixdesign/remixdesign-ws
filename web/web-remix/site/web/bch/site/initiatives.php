The organization's leadership hasfought many successful battles to secure the passage of legislation to enhance insurance coverage for patients, increase awareness, and ensure that cancerresearch and programs are funded.</p><h3>Breast Cancer Mapping Project and NYS Cancer Registry</h3><img class="image" src="images/map_table.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="145" alt="Breast Cancer Mapping Project" /><p>Lorraine Pace, Co-President of Breast Cancer Help, originated the ever-expanding breast cancer mapping project in 1992. This original mapping project spearheaded the breast cancer environmental movement. Lorraine and Breast Cancer Help assisted more than 25 breast cancer coalitions to form and map locally, nationally and abroad, including two minority coalitions at Sisters for Sisters with Beth El AME Church in Copiague and another in Coram, as well as the Marin County Breast Cancer Watch in 1995 with Chris Mason, Francine Levien and Dr. Roger Grimson. These mapping projects helped lead to the creation of the New York State Cancer Registry, through the efforts of New York State Senator Kemp Hannon. For more information on the zip code registries go to <a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us" target="_blank">www.health.state.ny.us</a>. To learn how you can conduct mapping in your community, contact Breast Cancer Help, Inc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="aw">Awareness</a></h2><p>Knowing that early detection is our best protection, Breast Cancer Helphas worked to increase awareness of breast cancer and othercancers. These efforts have included breast and testicular cancerawareness in public schools, establishment of diagosis and treatment hotlines, grassroots awareness campaigns, and working with members of the media to ensure that residents receive accurate and timely information about breast cancer and other cancers.</p><h3>Long Island Cancer Help and Wellness Center</h3><img class="image" src="images/wellnesscenter_32803.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="129" alt="Cancer Help and Wellness Center" /><p>In March of 2003, Breast Cancer Help opened its Long Island Cancer Help andWellness Center in Lindenhurst with the goal of increasing cancer awarenessto promote early detection, while providing patients and survivors withneeded support. Since then it has held numerous lectures to increase earlydetection and inform Long Islanders about medical advances and how to livehealthier. It has also developed ongoing programs to provide cancer patientsand survivors with the assistance they need to overcome cancer throughcomplementary integrative modalities that meet their psychosocial needs.These include a monthly support group, art therapy, massage therapy, andyoga. Under the guidance of its Executive Director, Lynda Distler, theCenter has established one of the region's most active cancer support andwellness programs.<a href="center/">Find out more</a>.</p><br class="clear" /><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="re">Research</a></h2><img class="image" src="images/csh_check.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="150" alt="Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory" /><p>Breast Cancer Help has worked with various elected officials toensure that cancer research is a national commitment. It also workedto establish the New York State Cancer Registry and a federally fundedstudy seeking to learn the causes of breast cancer and other cancers. It has also supported research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p><br class="clear" /><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="en">Ensuring Access to Advanced Medical Diagnosis and Treatment</a></h2><p>Breast Cancer Help has worked to ensure that Long Islanders have access to the best medical diagnosis andtreatment available. In 2001, it contributed $100,000 and procured an additional $250,000 to allow Stony BrookUniversity Hospital to purchase the first two of three modules for the Novalis Radio Surgery system. Later thatyear, it guaranteed a 63-month lease for the GE Digital Mammography System and began making lease payments inexcess of $7,000 per month. In 2003, it contributed half of the funds to purchase the Confirma CADstream MRIreader, allowing for improved diagnosis of breast MRIs.</p><h3>Novalis Radiosurgery</h3><img class="image" src="images/novalis.jpg" align="right" width="157" height="156" alt="Novalis Radiosurgery" /><p>To help fulfill our goal of ensuring that Long Islanders have access to the best possible medical care and diagnosis available, Breast Cancer Help contributed $100,000 and procured an additional $250,000 to allow Stony BrookUniversity Hospital to purchase the Novalis Radiosurgery Equipment at Stony Brook University Hospital. The technology is used for the non-invasive delivery of precise dose of high-energy radiation to a tumor located within the skull. It is available in the radiation oncology department of Stony Brook University Hospital and Medical Center.</p><p>For years, Breast Cancer Help directed all of the net proceeds of its current fundraising efforts toward the purchase of a lifesaving Novalis radiosurgery system for use in the radiation oncology department of Stony Brook University Hospital. Developed by BrainLAB, a manufacturer of powerful computer-guided medical instruments, the Novalis system represents cutting-edge technology in stereotactic radiosurgery; that is, the non-invasive delivery of a precise dose of high-energy radiation to a lesion located within the skull. This type of surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis and, because no incision is required, it avoids the risks, costs, and recovery time associated with traditional brain surgery.</p><p>The board and membership of Breast Cancer Help decided to undertake this goal because, having supported research efforts in the past, they wanted to fight cancer in the clinical setting in the interest of helping current cancer patients. Although primarily designed for treating brain tumors, the Novalis system does have some application with respect to breast cancer. Dr. Larry Reinstein, Professor of Radiation Oncology at Stony Brook, notes: "When breast cancer spreads to the brain, the Novalis system can be used to apply a precision dose of radiation to the affected area while avoiding radiation to normal tissue. It is a safer treatment with less side effects."</p><p>With further research the Novalis system can be used to deliver precise boosting to higher doses of radiation in specific areas of the breast for better disease control.</p><p>At the time of purchase, because this equipment is so new and expensive, there were only four such systems operating in the world. When Breast  Cancer Help donated phase one to Stony Brook University Hospital it was the first system available for use on Long Island. There was no hospital on Long Island with anything that could match the therapeutic capability of the Novalis system. The completed acquisition will further enhance Stony Brook's ability to provide excellence in cancer care.</p><p>Stony Brook's commitment to advancing cancer care was recognized in 1998 with federal and state grants enabling the establishment of the Cancer Institute of Long Island at Stony Brook, which is designed to serve as the region's premier cancer center. Combining the resources of a major research university with those of a major medical center has made Stony Brook the choice institution in the region for the establishment of a comprehensive cancer center supported by the National Cancer Institute.</p><img class="image" src="images/novalischeck.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="134" alt="Novalis check" /><p>The total cost of the Novalis system is $2.2 million and a phased approach is planned for the purchase of the equipment. The first phase involved the purchase of the initial machinery to treat regularly-shaped brain tumors from all types of cancer. The second phase, which is not completed, involved the purchase of machinery to treat tumors  with an irregular shape. Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney recently presented a check for $250,000 to be combined with a $100,000 contribution from Breast Cancer Help, to purchase this equipment. The equipment in the third phase must be purchased in one section at a cost in excess of $1 million. In addition to Breast Cancer Help's direct contribution, the completion of phase two was made possible by donations from the State University of New York, Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney, and various federal government entities.</p><br class="clear" /><h3>Digital Mammography</h3><img class="image" src="images/trunzo_digital_mammography.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="139" alt="Digital Mammography" /><p>Pictured (left-right), in front of a digital mammography system,are Deborah Schreifels, Director of Community Relations, StonyBrook University Hospital; Lorraine Pace, Co-President of BreastCancer Help, Inc.; NYS Senator Caesar Trunzo; Dr. Allen G. Meek,Chairman, Department of Radiation Oncology, Stony Brook UniversityHospital; Dr. Paul Fisher of Stony Brook University Hospital's LongIsland Cancer Center.  Trunzo is recently seen being thanked by thestaff of Stony Brook University Hospital and Breast Cancer Help forhis support in the fight against breast cancer.  The Senatorrecently secured a grant in the amount of $250,000 from New YorkState that is being used to cover over 32 months of leasing costsfor a digital mammography system currently in service at StonyBrook University Hospital.</p><p>In March of 2001, in a rare example of a non-profit organizationworking to improve the quality of health care on Long Island,Breast Cancer Help, Inc. guaranteed a 63-month lease agreement withGeneral Electric Medical Systems and began to make paymentsexceeding $7500 per month to provide Long Island's firstFDA-Approved, non-research, digital mammography system at StonyBrook Univeristy Hospital's Long Island Cancer Center.  In additionto being the first digital mammography unit available for clinicaluse on Long Island, it was also the first such unit available at anacademic medical center in New York State.  In addition to being astate of the art clinical tool, the digital mammography unit hasbeen available to researchers at Stony Brook to help advance thebreast cancer research program.</p><p>"This is a great day for all Long Island women.  We thank SenatorTrunzo for his efforts to ensure that Long Island women continue toreceive the most advanced and precise mammography screeningsavailable anywhere.  This is especially important for those womenwith dense breast tissue and for those who receive inconclusiveresults from standard mammographies. This technology is reassuringto any woman who may need a mammography to know that they do nothave to go far to receive the best possible diagnosis," saidLorraine Pace.</p><p>"I am pleased to have been successful in securing this funding tocover the leasing costs of the digital mammography system at StonyBrook University Hospital," said Senator Trunzo.  "Breast cancer isa serious health problem and early diagnosis and treatment arecritically important to saving lives.  This funding will helpensure that this vital service continues to be available to allwomen on Long Island.  Additionally, I would like to thank LorrainePace for her tireless efforts.  Over the past ten years, herenergy, advocacy, and support has helped countless women, and theirfamilies, face the challenge of breast cancer."</p><p>The advanced mammography system, known as the GE Senographe 2000DFull Field Digital Mammography system, retails at over $600,000.The system's digital technology offers the capability to acquireimages in near-real time, provides enhanced processing options andsuggests the possibility that mammograms may be taken at a lowerradiation doses, particularly in dense breasted women.</p><h3>Research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories</h3><img class="image" src="images/coldspringharbortour.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="128" alt="Cold Spring Harbor tour" /><p>Pictured are members of Breast Cancer Help withJeffrey Picarello (front, center), Director of Public Affairs atCold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Picarello recently discussed theimportant research being conducted at Cold Spring Harbor relatingto genetics and cancer at Breast Cancer Help's Long Island Cancer Help and Wellness Center in Lindenhurst.</p><p>Breast Cancer Help donated funds to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for the purchase of a confocal laser scanning microscope that allows researchers to view breast cancer cells three dimensionally, as the result of a grant received from Sons of Italy.</p><br class="clear" /><h3>CADStream MRI</h3><img class="image" src="images/confirma.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="126" alt="Confirma CADStream MRI" /><p>Pictured (left-right) are Lynda Distler, Executive Director, CancerHelp and Wellness Center; Lorraine Pace, Co-President, BreastCancer Help with Dr. Paul Fisher, Chief of Breast Imaging at StonyBrook University Hospital.
