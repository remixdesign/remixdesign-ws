They set out to find the correlation between breast cancer and the environment and to change the way the public thinks about this terrible disease. They refuse to accept the chronic under-funding of breast cancer research and the silence and indifference surrounding a disease. Breast cancer now claims the lives of 46,000 Americans each year, and has become one of the leading killers of women between ages 32 and 52.</p><p>With vision and perseverance, these community-minded men and women formed Breast Cancer Help, Inc., an organization with a focus on action and advocacy to eradicate breast cancer. Its founding President, Lorraine Pace, is a nationally known breast cancer survivor. Breast Cancer Help's Co-President, Reverend Thomas Arnao, who is currently a Vice Officialis for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, NY, has had the opportunity to counsel many women faced with the battle against breast cancer. Breast Cancer Help has built a grassroots network of advocates across America and abroad focusing on the goals of:</p><p class="list">• Increasing research into the cause, treatment, and cure of breast cancer</p><p class="list">• Improving access for all women to high-quality breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment</p><p class="list">• Encouraging other areas in the United States and throughout the world to conduct <a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/cancer/csii/nyscsii.htm" target="_blank">mapping surveys</a> to help better understand the relationship  between our environment and breast cancer</p><p>Since its inception, Breast Cancer Help has taken a multi-pronged approach to combating breast cancer. The organization has worked to mobilize citizens into breast cancer coalitions leading to breast cancer mapping projects; it has worked to bring cancer education into our schools; served as advocates to change state and local laws to preserve our environment; and worked to strengthen the rights of breast cancer patients.</p><p>The members of Breast Cancer Help are survivors, as well as the children, parents, spouses and friends of those who have survived and those who have not. Our supporters and member organizations encompass the universe of groups that care about this issue, including physicians, nurses, scientists, legislators, and many others. The organization is proud to be an active member of the Suffolk County Breast Health Partnership, the <a href="http://www.natlbcc.org/" target="_blank">National Breast Cancer Coalition</a>, the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, and the <a href="http://www.findacure.org/" target="_blank">Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Fund</a>. Among its many different activities, Breast Cancer Help advances change by disseminating information about how to do <a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/cancer/csii/nyscsii.htm" target="_blank">breast cancer mapping</a>, which is now sought by our nation's lawmakers and prestigious medical research institution.</p><h2>Breast Cancer Help, Inc.

In 1997 he was sent to Rome to pursue a doctorate in canon law at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas.</p><p>Father Tom's involvement with breast cancer started through his ministry as a parish priest at Our Lady of Lourdes parish in West Islip. As a priest he counseled many men and children who lost their loved ones to breast cancer. He saw firsthand the devastation caused by this disease. It was there that he became acquainted with Lorraine Pace, first as a parishioner, then as a friend. In 1992, Lorraine called him to tell him that she was diagnosed with breast cancer and asked for his help. At that point Father Tom committed himself to the fight against breast cancer. Determined to find the possible environmental causes of this dreaded disease Lorraine then founded Breast Cancer Help, Inc. Father Tom became Vice President of this organization and currently serves as Co-President along with Lorraine.</p><h3><a name="pace">Lorraine Pace, Founder and Co-President</a></h3><p>Lorraine Pace is a former Breast Cancer Education Specialist at the University Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook. As a breast health instructor certified by the American Cancer Society, the main aspect of her job was teaching high school students about breast cancer. She did this by showing videos on how to do self breast exams and distributing breast molds to teach the students to feel for lumps. She discussed the importance of mammography, in addition to breast self exam, in early detection of breast cancer. Besides high schools, she also taught at community groups, such as churches and temples. The teaching of breast cancer education helps raise awareness in the community, which is so important. Through teaching she helped to alleviate the fears of the students and women to whom she spoke and addressd the many myths about this disease.</p><p>Lorraine worked with Senator Kenneth LaValle to pass his bill which made breast cancer education a part of the high school health course description in New York State. This bill has been signed into law by Governor George Pataki. Lorraine has also met with other elected officials regarding breast cancer legislation. She supported the passage of the Pesticide Registry.  She also worked with Senator Owen Johnson on the check-off on income taxes to donate toward breast cancer research. Lorraine has met with Senator Kemp Hannon to amend the Tumor Registry to include occupational and residential history. It is now signed by Governor Pataki into law. Lorraine has worked Geri Barish of One in Nine on the Neighborhood Notification bill.</p><p>Another one of Lorraine's accomplishments was to help initiate the breast cancer awareness stamp. She did this by getting many petitions signed, writing letters and appearing on television shows.</p><p>Ms. Pace is a breast cancer survivor who initiated the mapping project in West Islip, NY shortly after she was diagnosed in 1992. She has many friends and neighbors in West Islip who were also diagnosed with breast cancer which prompted her to mail a survey to residents in her town and an overwhelming 63% responded to the survey. Dr. Roger Grimson, a biostatistician from Stony Brook, oversaw the project.</p><p>The mapping project lead Lorraine to start many breast cancer coalitions. The first one she started was the West Islip coalition. She has started many across Long Island, statewide, nationwide and even abroad. She is founder and Co-President of Breast Cancer Help, Inc.</p><p>Ms. Pace has tirelessly devoted her life in the fight against breast cancer. She has achieved this by working with the community, scientists, doctors and elected officials. She is a survivor, an activist and an advocate. She has dedicated her life to finding the cause of this horrific disease.</p><h3><a name="fezza">Alex Fezza</a></h3><p>Alex Fezza got involved with the breast cancer movement after his wife Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer. Alex, a postal worker, was partially responsible for changing the regulations regarding insurance coverage for stem cell infusion for federal workers and their spouses. He accomplished this by organizing an aggressive letter-writing campaign to Congress and the President.</p><h3><a name="jpace">John Pace</a></h3><p>John Pace, Esq., a practicing attorney and successful businessman, first became familiar with the breast cancer movement in 1992 as he accompanied Lorraine throughout Long Island in her quest to find a possible environmental cause of breast cancer and in particular the alarmingly high rate of this dreaded disease on Long Island. The following is some background information about the breast cancer movement. In 1992 there were numerous articles written about the incidence of breast cancer in Nassau County. Even though there was a high mortality rate of breast cancer in Suffolk County, many women had a false sense of security because of the lack of awareness. Shortly after my diagnosis of breast cancer, Lorraine founded the West Islip mapping project. The mapping showed that many of my neighbors in a small radius in West Islip were also diagnosed with this disease. This then prompted Lorraine along with volunteers to mail breast cancer surveys to the women of West Islip. Many women who completed the survey and did not have breast cancer then made appointments for checkups. Some of these women were later diagnosed with breast cancer. The mapping and survey started a movement of breast cancer awareness in Suffolk County. Robert Gaffney, Suffolk County Executive was instrumental in forming the Suffolk County Breast Health Partnership, an organization where breast cancer coalitions and other health agencies meet to discuss women's health and exchange information. Minority breast cancer groups have also been formed. The National Cancer Institute is now doing a GIS (Geographic Information System ) to determine if there is a correlation between breast cancer and one's environment and occupation. Suffolk County never had breast care centers before this movement. Now there are many of these centers, one being the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center which is affiliated with the University Hospital and Medical Center in Stony Brook.</p><p>John graduated Brooklyn Law School in June of 1958, where he had been a staff member of the Brooklyn Law Review from September, 1956 to June, 1958.  He also served as Book Review editor of the Brooklyn Law Review from Sept. 1957 to June, 1958. Admitted to practice in all of the courts of New York State, as well as federal courts, John became a partner with his brother, Anthony Pace and in 1958 joined the law firm of Pace & Pace. This law partnership continues to date. In addition, John participates with brothers Anthony and Frank in many business endeavors.</p><p>Lorraine needed help in start-up breast cancer activities. She asked John to form a not-for-profit organization in Oct. 1992 as Breast Cancer Coalition of Long Island, Inc. which was soon legally amended to West Islip Breast Cancer Coalition for Long Island, Inc. in Nov. 1992. He, thereafter, obtained federal tax exempt status for this group. All of this was done on a pro bono basis. In addition, John's personal residence almost became an office building as numerous meetings were held there in doing the extensive map study. Breast cancer meetings at his home continue to date.</p><p>Another not-for-profit was needed; it was in the formation of B C Help, Inc. in January of 1994, whose name was thereafter changed to Breast Cancer Help, Inc. in 1996. All of this legal work was done by John from his Pace & Pace law firm on a pro bono basis. He continues to serve as General Counsel, Board Member and Secretary. Federal income tax and New York State tax exemptions were also obtained through the efforts of John Pace. His house and office continue to serve as headquarters for Breast Cancer Help, Inc.</p><p>In Sept. 1996, there was a call for another 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation. John became a charter member in the creation of Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Fund, Inc. and once again did all of the legal work in its creation pro bono. This included reviewing contracts, obtaining Federal income tax and New York State sales tax exemption as well as fund raising. John served as general counsel, board member and secretary for this organization. During John's tenure this corporation raised one million dollars exclusively for breast cancer research at the University Hospital and Medical Center at the State University of Stony Brook.</p><p>All of John Pace's pro bono work continues to be a great asset to the breast cancer movement.</p><p>In March 2000 John was honored by Suffolk Life Newspaper. He was named "Person of the Year" in the law category for the Town of Islip.</p><?php include ('footer.php');?>
