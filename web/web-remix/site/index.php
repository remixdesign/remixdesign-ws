I define it as "change" in the sense of not completely reinventing or 		revolutionizing with every design, but 		having each design be different from the previous and move gradually in new directions. It entails thought-out 		experimentation that knows its destination and serves the concept of the project. My goal is to promote a 		business reflecting a sense of purposeful change, something surprisingly different than both the bland corporate 		look and the pseudo-modern "cool".</p>				<p>I'm Leisl Schrader, and this is my portfolio. It is pleased to meet you.</p>				<p>&nbsp;</p>				<h2>What I Did on my Summer Vacation</h2>		<h6>posted 20 June 2006</h6>				<p>Well, first off, I finished adding past work to my portfolio. Both web and print have new goodies for 		your viewing pleasure. Second, I became Art Director of <a href="http://www.purpleskymagazine.com">purple SKY magazine</a>, 		so expect more from this fine music publication in the near future. I also finally got an air conditioner in my apartment, 		bought tickets for the Family Values tour, and went to my little brother's high school graduation. Haven't been to the beach 		yet. The whole "sitting in front of a computer all day" thing doesn't exactly make for a picturesque bathing suit figure. =X</p>				<h4>New and updated works</h4>				<ul>		<li><a href="print/pitshirts/">Pit Shirts</a></li>		<li><a href="print/adc/">ADC Spring Paper Expo</a></li>		<li><a href="print/pp/">Penis Poetry</a></li>		<li><a href="print/narutarded/">Narutarded</a></li>		<li><a href="web/purplesky/">purple SKY magazine</a></li>		<li><a href="web/ajourney/">A Journey</a></li>		<li><a href="print/loveisfake/">Love is fake.</a></li>		</ul>		</div></div></body></html>
