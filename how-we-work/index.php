<h3>Phase 1 &nbsp; <strong>Informing</strong></h3>

<p>When you decide that Remix Design might be right for your business, get in touch using the information on our contact page and provide a request for proposal (RFP) or summary of your project. We will reply promptly with a confirmation and request additional information if necessary.</p>

<p>At our first consultation meeting, we'll get to know each other a little better. We'll gather as much information as possible about your company and your needs. Equally, you'll learn more about our company, our experience, and our capability to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Next, we will create a detailed proposal document that summarizes your needs and our solution, and outlines project contents, timeline, budget, payment terms, and legal terms.</p>

<p>Please note that no speculative projects will be accepted, and that no design work will be provided until both parties are under contract.</p>

<h3>Phase 2 &nbsp; <strong>Thinking</strong></h3>

<p>Once everything is down in writing, then the fun begins. We'll work with you to transform our ideas into the perfect design solution.</p>

<p>Based on the information gathered in Phase 1, we will brainstorm numerous concrete ideas. We'll present these ideas to you in the form of mockups – rough visuals showing what the final product might look like. We'll get your feedback on what you like and dislike, and based on this, present a second set of mockupus. Through about 3 to 5 "rounds" of revisions, a single final version be refined.</p>

<p>For identity and print projects, Phase 2 typically takes the longest of all four stages. Client involvement and feedback is crucial during this phase. We'll keep in touch via email and phone, and may schedule additional meetings. There is an invoice generated at the completion of this phase.</p>

<h3>Phase 3 &nbsp; <strong>Building</strong></h3>

<p>The heavy lifting must be done in Phase 3. The solution from Phase 2 forms the basis of many other design decisions, which are applied systematically to every aspect of the project. Concrete deliverables materialize.</p>

<p>For web projects, Phase 3 typically takes the longest of all four stages. It is when flat mockups are built into functioning pages or full animations. </p>

<p>Since this is a production-centric phase, client involvement is not as necessary. There may be an invoice generated at the completion of this stage.</p>

<h3>Phase 4 &nbsp; <strong>Finishing</strong></h3>

<p>Finally, we will see the project through to the end. Quality control before delivery, for both web and print, is never sacrificed. </p>

<p>Client involvement is once again crucial, as we test, check for errors, or squeeze in last minute revisions. An invoice invoice is generated before delivery. When all invoices are up to date, the project will be delivered. Web projects are pushed live, and print projects are sent to printers.</p>

<p>For print projects, proofing adds an extra step. This takes more time before the final product is printed, usually about a week. This work will be invoiced separately.</p>

<p>Upon project completion, you will also receive a feedback survey to let us know how we've done and what you'd like to see in future work.</p>
